{"200A":{"department":"STS","number":"200A","title":"Food and Society: Politics, Culture and Technology","description":"This course will examine how politics, culture, and technology intersect in our food practices. Through a survey of academic, journalistic, and artistic works on food and eating, the course will explore a set of key analytical frameworks and conceptual tools in STS, such as the politics of technology, classification and identity, and nature/culture boundaries. The topics covered include: the industrialization of agriculture; technology and the modes of eating (e.g., the rise of restaurants); food taboos; globalization and local foodways; food and environmentalism; and new technologies in production (e.g., genetically modified food). Through food as a window, the course intends to achieve two broad intellectual goals. First, students will explore various theoretical and methodological approaches in STS. In particular, they will pay particular attention to the ways in which politics, culture, and technology intersect in food practices. Second, student will develop a set of basic skills and tools for their own critical thinking and empirical research, and design and conduct independent research on a topic related to food. First class attendance mandatory. STS majors must have Senior status to enroll in this Senior Capstone course.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-SI", "WAY-ED"],"id":213735,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sato, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Sato, K."],"location":"School of Education 313"}],"id":28548}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
