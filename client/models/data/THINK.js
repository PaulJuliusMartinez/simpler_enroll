How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and importantly how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing. Note: This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, \"dorm lab\" component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth. We hope to inculcate in our students \"a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. \" (Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AQR","WAY-SMA"],"id":213213,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"370-370"}],"id":28613}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28791},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28650},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28648},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28649},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28618},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28651},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28652},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28790}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

How can natural and social sciences, humanities, and technology fields interact to contribute to their solution? How do we balance the needs and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations? The term sustainability seems to be everywhere.  Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals. You will learn to develop policy briefs addressing sustainability issues in the university, local communities, state and the nation as well as work on team projects with decision makers that address real-life challenges in your local area.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-SMA"],"id":214420,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"Hewlett Teaching Center 102"}],"id":20033}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20092},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20095},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20094},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20093}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

How does thinking about love lead us to ask other important philosophical and social questions? In this course we will examine the classical roots, medieval developments, and contemporary permutations of Western ideas of romantic love. With an eye to thinking about representations of love in our own culture, we consider some of the foundational love books of the Western tradition. From Plato's Symposium to Chester Brown's graphic novel Paying For It, we ask the fundamental question of whether and how we might distinguish between spiritual and physical desire. We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender. We discuss these works of the past, for example the illicit love in the courtly romance Tristan, in tandem with representations of clandestine love from the present day, such as the portrayal of same-sex love in Brokeback Mountain.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-ED"],"id":215407,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":"260-113"}],"id":1002}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"300-303"}],"id":29811},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"300-303"}],"id":29238},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"300-303"}],"id":29812},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"300-303"}],"id":29810}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

How do people convey experiences that are by definition extra-ordinary to others? In this course we ask the big (and unanswerable) question why people believe in God. Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear. Our aim is to show how different disciplines can work together to cast light on a basic question of human existence.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-A-II","WAY-SI"],"id":215408,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"Lathrop 299"}],"id":20369}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:05:00 PM","location":"200-105"}],"id":30107},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"200-105"}],"id":30109},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":"200-105"}],"id":30108},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"200-105"}],"id":29590}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

It was only in the 20th century that cosmology developed from metaphysical and theological speculation to become an observational science and a recognized part of physics. In this course, students will explore questions about the Universe, its beginnings, its structure, its extent, its fate, from several perspectives - philosophical, experimental, and theoretical.

Gender Diversity and Leadership","description":"Why there are so few women leaders and what is the cost to society for women's underrepresentation in positions of power? How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training. Students will develop practical, real-world skills to increase their own leadership capacities by working on projects and taking part in interactive sessions on negotiation and team dynamics.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-ED","WAY-SI"],"id":215410,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"Ceras 300"}],"id":20371}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:05:00 PM","location":"260-301"}],"id":29589},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"160-322"}],"id":30097},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"200-219"}],"id":30101},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":30098},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"School of Education 41"}],"id":30100},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":30099}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Democratic and republican revolutions transformed ancient Greece and Rome - and later transformed the modern world. We explore how political thinkers, from Machiavelli to Madison and Mill, used the lessons of ancient politics to design bold new systems of government. Ancient politics may still hold lessons for us.

Viewed through the lens of medicine, the body is a text that offers clues to health and illness, yet clinical readings are never entirely objective. Culture informs and distorts how we discern, accept, reject, and analyze our bodies. Looking at literary, medical, ethical, and anthropological texts, we ask how representations of the body affects the way we experience illness, embody gender and racial identities, and understand our rights (or lack of rights) to control our own bodies.

Sir Thomas More gave a name to the philosophical ideal of a good society - a word that is now a part of common language: utopia. In the almost 500 years since More's Utopia appeared, changes in society - including enormous advances in science and technology - have opened up new possibilities for the utopian society that More and his predecessors could not have envisioned.
