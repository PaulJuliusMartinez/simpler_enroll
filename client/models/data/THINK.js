How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and importantly how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing. Note: This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, \"dorm lab\" component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth. We hope to inculcate in our students \"a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. \" (Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AQR", "THINK", "WAY-SMA"],"id":213213,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Block, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Skotheim, J.","Block, S.","Pande, V."],"location":"370-370"}],"id":16382}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":28956},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":28955},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sengupta, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Betre, K.","Sengupta, P."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28951},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Betre, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Sengupta, P.","Betre, K."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28953},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Park, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Park, M."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":16416},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ronan, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ronan, J.","Sengupta, P."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28958},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Park, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Park, M."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28949},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ronan, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Sengupta, P.","Ronan, J."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28957}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world.

In 1865, the peace treaty was signed at Appomattox and the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but the battle over memory and national identity had just begun.  The questions that the Civil War addressed - and failed to address - continue to affect our lives today.  We will focus on how Americans negotiated issues of cultural memory and national identity through a close analysis of historical texts, novels, poems, films, paintings, cartoons, photographs, and music.  Our interpretations will foreground the particular themes of race and nationhood, freedom and citizenship, and changing notions of individual and collective identity. Our assumption in this course is that history is not available to us as a set of events - fixed, past, and unchanging. Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories? And in what ways?  The stories we choose to tell about the past can shape not only our understanding of the present, but also the kind of future we imagine and strive to realize.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-A-II", "WAY-ED"],"id":213242,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Fishkin, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hobbs, A.","Fishkin, S."],"location":"Lathrop 299"}],"id":27329}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sengupta, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Sengupta, P.","McCormack, K."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28933},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28935},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sengupta, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Sengupta, P.","McCormack, K."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28934},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28936}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

How can natural and social sciences, humanities, and technology fields interact to contribute to their solution? How do we balance the needs and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations? The term sustainability seems to be everywhere.  Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals. You will learn to develop policy briefs addressing sustainability issues in the university, local communities, state and the nation as well as work on team projects with decision makers that address real-life challenges in your local area.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-SMA"],"id":214420,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Matson, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Gerritsen, M.","Matson, P."],"location":"320-220"}],"id":44710}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Harris, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Harris, A."],"location":"200-202"}],"id":44728},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sengupta, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Carlisle, L.","Sengupta, P."],"location":"School of Education 130"}],"id":44726},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lyons, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Lyons, A."],"location":"Encina West 108"}],"id":46963},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Harris, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Harris, A."],"location":"200-202"}],"id":44729},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lyons, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Lyons, A."],"location":"School of Education 130"}],"id":46330}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Some scholars argue that belief results from direct experience, such as visions or moments of transcendence, that testify to God's existence. Others suggest that belief in the supernatural is better explained by the way the human mind has evolved or people's experience of the social world. In this class, we will pair medieval literature on Christian mysticism and magic with readings from modern psychology and anthropology. We will look at the dominant answers provided by each discipline. For example, belief might result from our sensory experience of the world, or it might have developed as part of our cognitive apparatus in response to fear.

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training.

The class will also give students the chance to participate in various story-making activities and work with the Stanford Storytelling Project, San Francisco StoryCorps, School of the Arts and the Stanford Innocence Project to create assignments that would be useful to both private and nonprofit organizations.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-CE", "THINK", "WAY-A-II"],"id":215413,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Johnson, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Johnson, A.","Vermeule, B."],"location":"200-002"}],"id":45654}]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"200-107"}],"id":45709},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tate, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tate, B."],"location":"240-101"}],"id":45722},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Norako, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Norako, L."],"location":"200-105"}],"id":45706},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Norako, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Norako, L."],"location":"200-105"}],"id":45707},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sengupta, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Sengupta, P.","Hillenbrand, S."],"location":"160-326"}],"id":45705},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sengupta, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Sengupta, P.","Hillenbrand, S."],"location":"160-326"}],"id":45666},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tate, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tate, B."],"location":"240-101"}],"id":45721},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"200-107"}],"id":45708}]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Students will be asked to consider how words are formed, and who chooses what gets accepted into the dictionary. What do words reveal about status, class, race? Why are there so many derogatory words for women, but so few for men? We will enquire about how the words we use have changed over time, both through shifts in meaning, and through the life and death of words. We&iquest;ll seek to discover how different cultures make sense of the world through specific sets of words, but also why the world loses an average of one language every two weeks. We&iquest;ll explore how we create new names for things, from a `refrigerator&iquest; to `Google&iquest;. We&iquest;ll ask how words function in relation to the Internet, and how coding can be thought of as language.  Words are the key to understanding the minds and ideas of a people and in tracing the biographies of words we are able to discern how the world was, is, and might be perceived and described. The course will be structured through a sequence of weekly words that are the starting point for a discussion on a major characteristic of the dynamic and fascinating world of words.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-A-II", "WAY-ED"],"id":216659,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Treharne, E."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Treharne, E.","Ogilvie, S."],"location":"260-113"}],"id":46334}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Spiess, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Spiess, S."],"location":"Sweet303"}],"id":46068},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Spiess, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Spiess, S."],"location":"Sweet303"}],"id":46069},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tate, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tate, B."],"location":"240-110"}],"id":46067},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tate, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tate, B."],"location":"240-110"}],"id":45136}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},
