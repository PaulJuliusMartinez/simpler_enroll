{"1":{"department":"THINK","number":"1","title":"The Science of MythBusters","description":"How do scientists actually go about answering practical questions? How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and importantly how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing. Note: This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, \"dorm lab\" component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth. We hope to inculcate in our students \"a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. \" (Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AQR", "THINK", "WAY-SMA"],"id":213213,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Skotheim, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Block, S.","Skotheim, J.","Pande, V."],"location":"370-370"}],"id":16382}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Park, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Park, M."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28953},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Betre, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Betre, K."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":16416},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ronan, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ronan, J."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28958},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Betre, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Betre, K."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28949},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Park, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Park, M."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28951},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ronan, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Ronan, J."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28957},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":28955},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Hillenbrand, S."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":28956}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories? And in what ways?

How can natural and social sciences, humanities, and technology fields interact to contribute to their solution? How do we balance the needs and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations? The term sustainability seems to be everywhere.  Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals.

How can organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society? Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all the undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women comprise only 17% of US Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 22% of tenured faculty at Stanford, and less than a fifth of law firm partners. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Yet, research shows that gender diversity increases the creativity and innovation of groups. In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom. We will be using modules based on those used in businesses schools and corporate executive training.

It deals both with competing visions of what democracy might be, and their actual realization not only in the US but around the world. It will begin with the debate over the American founding and move eventually to the &iquest;third wave&iquest; of democratization around the world in the late 20th century as well as its more recent retrenchment.  The problems of democratic reform are continuing and recurrent around the world.

"52":{"department":"THINK","number":"52","title":"World of Words","description":"In this course, we define and make sense of the world around us through the words we use. Students will be asked to consider how words are formed, and who chooses what gets accepted into the dictionary. What do words reveal about status, class, race? Why are there so many derogatory words for women, but so few for men? We will enquire about how the words we use have changed over time, both through shifts in meaning, and through the life and death of words. We&iquest;ll seek to discover how different cultures make sense of the world through specific sets of words, but also why the world loses an average of one language every two weeks. We&iquest;ll explore how we create new names for things, from a `refrigerator&iquest; to `Google&iquest;. We&iquest;ll ask how words function in relation to the Internet, and how coding can be thought of as language.  Words are the key to understanding the minds and ideas of a people and in tracing the biographies of words we are able to discern how the world was, is, and might be perceived and described. The course will be structured through a sequence of weekly words that are the starting point for a discussion on a major characteristic of the dynamic and fascinating world of words.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-A-II", "WAY-ED"],"id":216659,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"260-113"}],"id":46334}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"200-217"}],"id":46071},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tate, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tate, B."],"location":"240-110"}],"id":46067},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Spiess, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Spiess, S."],"location":"Sweet303"}],"id":46069},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tate, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tate, B."],"location":"240-110"}],"id":45136},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"200-217"}],"id":46070},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Spiess, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Spiess, S."],"location":"Sweet303"}],"id":46068}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

In the 2010s, it is just 1 in 150. This course tries to explain this astonishing shift away from violence. We will look at the history of war from the Stone Age to the robot age, including the conflicts of the 2010s; and we will draw on everything from anthropology and archaeology to biology and psychology, as we try to answer one of the biggest questions of all: will there ever be a world without war?  Students learn how to approach a big, complex, and often very politicized question in an analytical manner.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-SI"],"id":216661,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Morris, I."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Morris, I."],"location":"260-113"}],"id":29090}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Blome, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Blome, D."],"location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":29091},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Carter, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Carter, T."],"location":"Thornt211"}],"id":29097},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Baer, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Baer, A."],"location":"School of Education 207"}],"id":29094},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Blome, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"3:50:00 PM","instructors":["Blome, D."],"location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":29092},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Carter, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Carter, T."],"location":"Thornt211"}],"id":29096},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Baer, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Baer, A."],"location":"School of Education 207"}],"id":29095}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"}}
