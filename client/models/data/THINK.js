{"1":{"department":"THINK","number":"1","title":"The Science of MythBusters","description":"How do scientists actually go about answering practical questions? How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and importantly how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing. Note: This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, \"dorm lab\" component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth. We hope to inculcate in our students \"a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. \" (Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AQR", "THINK", "WAY-SMA"],"id":213213,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Skotheim, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Pande, V.","Block, S.","Skotheim, J."],"location":"370-370"}],"id":16382}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Park, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Park, M."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28953},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Betre, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Betre, K."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28949},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Park, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Park, M."],"location":"Lathrop 294"}],"id":28951},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":28955},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":28956},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ronan, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ronan, J."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28957},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ronan, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Ronan, J."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28958},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":16416}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Approximately one in three Americans will develop invasive cancer during their lifetime; one in five Americans will die as a result of this disease. This course will expose you to multiple ways of approaching the cancer problem, including laboratory research, clinical trials, population studies, public health interventions, and health care economics. We will start with the 18th century discovery of the relationship between coal tar and cancer, and trace the role of scientific research in revealing the genetic basis of cancer. We will then discuss the development of new treatments for cancer as well as measures to screen for and prevent cancer, including the ongoing debate over tobacco control. Using cancer as a case study, you will learn important aspects of the scientific method including experimental design, data analysis, and the difference between correlation and causation.  You will learn how science can be used and misused with regard to the public good. You will also learn about ways in which social, political, and economic forces shape our knowledge about and response to disease.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AQR", "THINK", "WAY-SMA"],"id":213235,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lipsick, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Lipsick, J."],"location":"370-370"}],"id":28939}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tennen, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Tennen, R."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28942},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28947},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"200-105"}],"id":28943},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tennen, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Tennen, R."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28941},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28948},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"200-105"}],"id":28944},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Van de Mark, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Van de Mark, D."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28945},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Van de Mark, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Van de Mark, D."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28946}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

How did Americans reimagine the United States as a nation after the war?  Who belonged in the national community and who would be excluded? In 1865, the peace treaty was signed at Appomattox and the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but the battle over memory and national identity had just begun.  The questions that the Civil War addressed - and failed to address - continue to affect our lives today.  We will focus on how Americans negotiated issues of cultural memory and national identity through a close analysis of historical texts, novels, poems, films, paintings, cartoons, photographs, and music.  Our interpretations will foreground the particular themes of race and nationhood, freedom and citizenship, and changing notions of individual and collective identity. Our assumption in this course is that history is not available to us as a set of events - fixed, past, and unchanging. Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories? And in what ways?  The stories we choose to tell about the past can shape not only our understanding of the present, but also the kind of future we imagine and strive to realize.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-A-II", "WAY-ED"],"id":213242,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Fishkin, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hobbs, A.","Fishkin, S."],"location":"Lathrop 299"}],"id":27329}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["McCormack, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["McCormack, K."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28933},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28935},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["McCormack, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["McCormack, K."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":28934},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perkins, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Perkins, S."],"location":"Lathrop 298"}],"id":28936}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

With an eye to thinking about representations of love in our own culture, we consider some of the foundational love books of the Western tradition. From Plato's Symposium to Chester Brown's graphic novel Paying For It, we ask the fundamental question of whether and how we might distinguish between spiritual and physical desire. We consider how medieval and contemporary writers dealt with the relation of love to sex, power, money, marriage, and gender. We discuss these works of the past, for example the illicit love in the courtly romance Tristan, in tandem with representations of clandestine love from the present day, such as the portrayal of same-sex love in Brokeback Mountain.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK", "WAY-A-II", "WAY-ED"],"id":215407,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lummus, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Starkey, K.","Lummus, D."],"location":"260-113"}],"id":16498}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Norako, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Norako, L."],"location":"300-303"}],"id":28928},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Kania, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Kania, R."],"location":"200-107"}],"id":28930},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"200-107"}],"id":28932},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"200-107"}],"id":28931},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Norako, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Norako, L."],"location":"300-303"}],"id":16499},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Kania, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Kania, R."],"location":"200-107"}],"id":28929}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},
