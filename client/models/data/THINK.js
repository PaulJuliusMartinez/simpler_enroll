How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and -- importantly -- how does it differ from other approaches?  As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories, in a variety of imaginative ways. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing.  We hope to inculcate in our students &quot; a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. &quot; (Yves Quéré, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AQR","WAY-SMA"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]}],[],[]],"secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"09:00:00","end":"09:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00","end":"13:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}]}],[],[]]},

The aforementioned works are generally bound to what has been a successful Broadway musical formula, which emerged in the mid to early 20th century with musicals like Oklahoma!

However, musical theater is a vastly untapped resource of potential artistic innovation and has unfortunately become stuck in an ideal of universal accessibility. In this course, students should begin to create pieces that are fresh and innovative forms of musical theater that do not necessarily appeal to specifically popular audiences but perhaps to audiences more associated with high art, opera, or even contemporary independent music (indie rock et al.).

The problem isn&#39;t as widely discussed as distracted driving, but the danger is real.&quot; These two very different ways of circulating in urban space suggest that a major shift in how we humans relate to our environment has occurred over the course of nearly two centuries--especially in the densely populated spaces of modern cities. Where the great spectacle of urban life was a marvel of the nineteenth century, today&#39;s inhabitants want mainly to block it out by insulating themselves in a cocoon of favorite music or personal conversation, whether by voice or text, that they risk stepping into traffic, colliding with lightposts, or bumping into others similarly self-absorbed. This seminar proposes to think about the hows and whys of that important shift from the unique perspective of art history, a field of study especially attuned to the limits and exigencies of visual acuity.

As background for understanding the Copernican revolution and its aftermath, we begin with a brief examination of Plato and Aristotle, and how these two Ancient Greek thinkers were later taken up in the medieval period, resulting in a synthesis in which science, philosophy, and religion were intimately interconnected. Against this background we will then focus on the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries and encounter thinkers who during their lifetimes defied easy categorization: Were Galileo and Newton philosophers or scientists? What about Descartes and Leibniz? In reading texts that we now understand as belonging to one or the other category, we will see how the two disciplines eventually became sharply distinguished from one another ¿ which then led, in turn, to the modern separation between science and religion.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AII"],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}]}],[]],"secondary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"09:00:00","end":"09:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]]},

Anthropologists call these rituals. Rituals shape every aspect of our lives, creating our symbolic universes and governing the most minute of our practices.  For early anthropologists and for those interested in religious and symbolic life, rituals and rites were seen as both one of the most universal features of human existence, and, as that which enables us to reflect upon our human existence. A prominent example are that of the ¿rites de passage¿ found in every culture, from puberty initiation rites, weddings or funerals, which socially signal the change from one status to another. While initially for anthropologists, rituals marked the difference between the sacred and the profane, soon scholars began to see the ubiquity of ritual and the symbolic in shaping even the most mundane activity such as the structure of a meal and why one is not meant to eat dessert before the main course. The first half of the class examines these different debates surrounding the meaning and effects of rituals and rites. The second half of the class takes these debates to think about the question of power and politics. We return to the question of how our symbolic universes are staged and imagined by us through ritual forms such as the annual Presidential ¿pardoning the turkey¿ at Thanksgiving. The question of power however pushes us even further to ask why it is that we obey particular kinds of authority, consent to particular actions, and find ourselves doing things we haven¿t consciously decided to do. Many have argued that these kinds of political questions about how we respond and are shaped by power have something to do with our symbolic worlds and ritual, from the most obvious (the monarchy) to the most subtle (listening in a classroom). Throughout the course, these abstract questions will be grounded in cross-cultural examples and analysis.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}]}],[]]},

When we do the former, we act prudently.  When we do the latter, we act morally.  This course explores the debate among philosophers about the source of our reasons for acting prudently and morally.  Some argue that our reasons to be prudent and moral stem directly from the fact that we are rational ¿ that it is contrary to reason to ignore our own future interests, or the interests of other people.  Others disagree, arguing that the source of these reasons must lie elsewhere.

What are the mechanisms of evolution, and how are they discovered and explored?  What are the practical implications of evolution for agriculture, medicine, and the future of life on earth?  The history of life on earth is inextricably intertwined with the history of geological change on earth. Early ideas about biological evolution came from young people who went on wild adventures. Their observations generated ideas about what must have happened; but since, at the time, little was known about the mechanisms of inheritance, they were never to know how it happened. In time, two major advances came along: a much more comprehensive fossil record that substantiated many of their ideas, and a deep understanding of genetic mechanisms of inheritance. In parallel, the idea of geologic forms as dynamic, especially volcanic eruptions and plate tectonics, provided a new narrative of earth history that informed ideas about spreading and changing life forms. Then mechanisms of developmental biology showed how inherited genes carry out recipes for building bodies with certain structures.  We will examine evolution from scientific, historical, and artistic perspectives, including evolution of microbes, plants, animals, and humans, and implications of evolution for medicine.

And we sometimes think we should do something for the sake of another person, even when it is inconvenient, costly, or unpleasant (e.g. we stop to help a stranded motorist, donate to charity, or tell someone an embarrassing truth rather than a face-saving lie).  When we do the former, we act prudently.  When we do the latter, we act morally.  This course explores the debate among philosophers about the source of our reasons for acting prudently and morally.  Some argue that our reasons to be prudent and moral stem directly from the fact that we are rational ¿ that it is contrary to reason to ignore our own future interests, or the interests of other people.  Others disagree, arguing that the source of these reasons must lie elsewhere.

Yet under pressure, this distinction can appear to collapse ¿ we find that we cannot successfully disentangle what a person controls from what she does not when she acts.  This course examines this problem in depth, and considers how we might respond in the face of it:  Is it really a problem?  If so, does it threaten our moral practices?

Energy use is intricately woven through the fabric of the productive (and comfortable) lives we live in the developed world.  We use energy to move and sometimes make fresh water, grow food, transport it to markets, heat, cool, and light our dwellings and workplaces, communicate and compute, and travel the world.  We worry about energy security and fret about the cost of gasoline.  And as world population continues to grow and the developing world seeks to use energy for the services we enjoy, the challenge of supplying the energy the world needs will grow commensurately.  Energy is also a primary way human activities interact with global air, water, and biological systems that provide essential services to us and the planet.

How do we balance the needs and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations?  The term ¿sustainability¿ seems to be everywhere.  Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development¿improving human well-being while preserving Earth¿s life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run¿and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals. You will learn to develop policy briefs addressing sustainability issues in the university, local communities, state and the nation as well as work on team projects with decision makers that address real-life challenges in your local area.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-SMA"],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]],"secondary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"09:00:00","end":"09:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00"}]}],[]]},

How is your mental life anchored to your physical self?  You wake up from a dreamless sleep and suddenly everything&#39;s buzzing with color and sound.  Somehow your brain sustains this rich landscape of experience, integrating it with a repertoire of memories to constitute yourself.  This course probes the neurobiological bases of these familiar yet miraculous facets of the mind.  You&#39;ll learn to analyze primary philosophical and scientific texts, using basic knowledge of the brain to assess and even innovate experiments that could shed light on the nature of consciousness and personal identity.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AII","WAY-SMA"],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}]],"secondary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"18:15:00","end":"19:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"17:15:00","end":"18:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"09:00:00","end":"09:50:00"}]}]]},

How do improvements in human well-being come about? In this course, we will explore concepts of wealth and well-being by focusing on the African experience. We will equip you with the tools and techniques of three diverse disciplines &quot;history, political science, and engineering&quot; as you tackle essential questions about the meaning of development and how to measure it, the long-run impact of historical events, the role of politics in the development process, and the challenges of engineering improvements to human well-being. You will tackle primary source documents as we explore the slave trade and colonial rule; you will engage cutting-edge social science as we dissect contemporary trends; and you will learn how engineers are grappling with the importance of the contexts in which they operate.

Journeys will examine works written across a span of some 2,300 years, from Chinese philosophy to American short stories.  Each of these forms and genres presents some essential aspect of the journey we all share, and of the various passages we make within that one great journey that relentlessly challenge and transform us even as we advance toward what the poet Thomas Gray called our &quot;inevitable hour.&quot; By reading, discussing, and interpreting these works, we will ask you to consider how each text compels us, by the penetration of its vision and the power of its art, to make part of our own journey in its company.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AII","WAY-ER"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]}],[],[]],"secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"09:00:00","end":"09:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00","end":"13:05:00"}]}],[],[]]},

How do our different definitions of nature ¿ scientific, literary, cultural, and historical ¿ shape the way we answer that question?  Sustainability and Collapse will explore what people in different places and periods of time have envisioned as successful ways of living with nature and how such ways of life have come under pressure. We will focus particularly on the interface between scientific and humanistic approaches to questions of environmental sustainability through a study of novels, historical texts, and works of biogeography. You will learn to ask how textual and visual images inform our ideas about what it means to live sustainably. We will then consider whether those ideas are in accordance with or in conflict with scientific understandings of human uses of nature.

What does their behavior tell us about their inner lives, and about ourselves? What do lipstick and cuckoos and fireflies have in common? Why would nobody want to be a penguin? What do mice say to each other in their pee-mail? Learning how to think about questions like these gives us a unique perspective on the natural world. Format: Discussion and criticism of video examples, documentaries, and research papers. Topics: History and approaches to animal behavior; development of behavior, from genetics to learning; mechanisms of behavior, from neurons to motivation; function of behavior, from honest signals to selfish genes; the phylogeny of behavior, from domestication to speciation; and modern applications of behavior, from abnormal behavior, to conservation, to animal welfare, and animal consciousness.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SMA"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:35:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:35:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}]]},

Sir Thomas More gave a name to the philosophical ideal of a ¿good society¿ ¿ a word that is now a part of common language: utopia. In the almost 500 years since More¿s Utopia appeared, changes in society ¿ including enormous advances in science and technology ¿ have opened up new possibilities for the utopian society that More and his predecessors could not have envisioned. At the same time science and technology also entail risks that suggest more dystopian scenarios ¿ in their most extreme form, threats to humanity¿s very survival. We will look at several works that consider how literary visions of society have evolved with the progress of science and technology. The readings begin with More and include examples of more technologically determined visions of the late 20th century, as imagined in works of fiction.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AII"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[],[]],"secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"18:15:00","end":"19:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"17:15:00","end":"18:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00","end":"13:05:00"}]}],[],[]]}}
