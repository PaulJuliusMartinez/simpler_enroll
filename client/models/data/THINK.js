How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and -- importantly -- how does it differ from other approaches?nnAs its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories, in a variety of imaginative ways. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing.  We hope to inculcate in our students \" a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. \" (Yves Quéré, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AQR","WAY-SMA"],"id":213213,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00","location":"420-041"}],"id":37670}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00","location":"Encina West 101"}],"id":56970},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"10:50:00","location":"Meyer 147"}],"id":37798},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00","location":"Meyer 147"}],"id":37794},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00","location":"Meyer 147"}],"id":37790},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00","location":"Meyer 147"}],"id":37690},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"09:00:00","end":"09:50:00","location":"Meyer 147"}],"id":37796},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00","location":"Encina West 101"}],"id":56971},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00","location":"Meyer 147"}],"id":37792}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

What are the mechanisms of evolution, and how are they discovered and explored?  What are the practical implications of evolution for agriculture, medicine, and the future of life on earth?nnnThe history of life on earth is inextricably intertwined with the history of geological change on earth. Early ideas about biological evolution came from young people who went on wild adventures. Their observations generated ideas about what must have happened; but since, at the time, little was known about the mechanisms of inheritance, they were never to know how it happened. In time, two major advances came along: a much more comprehensive fossil record that substantiated many of their ideas, and a deep understanding of genetic mechanisms of inheritance. In parallel, the idea of geologic forms as dynamic, especially volcanic eruptions and plate tectonics, provided a new narrative of earth history that informed ideas about spreading and changing life forms. Then mechanisms of developmental biology showed how inherited genes carry out recipes for building bodies with certain structures. nnnWe will examine evolution from scientific, historical, and artistic perspectives, including evolution of microbes, plants, animals, and humans, and implications of evolution for medicine.  The course will include introductory lectures, some in class and some online, discussion sessions, and three team projects for each student.

Energy use is intricately woven through the fabric of the productive (and comfortable) lives we live in the developed world.  We use energy to move and sometimes make fresh water, grow food, transport it to markets, heat, cool, and light our dwellings and workplaces, communicate and compute, and travel the world.  We worry about energy security and fret about the cost of gasoline.  And as world population continues to grow and the developing world seeks to use energy for the services we enjoy, the challenge of supplying the energy the world needs will grow commensurately.

We will look at several works that consider how literary visions of society have evolved with the progress of science and technology. The readings begin with More and include examples of more technologically determined visions of the late 20th century, as imagined in works of fiction.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AII"],"id":213222,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00","location":"370-370"}],"id":37684}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:05:00","location":"Meyer 144"}],"id":37856},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00","end":"13:05:00","location":"160-329"}],"id":37866},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"14:05:00","location":"160-329"}],"id":37868},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:05:00","location":"300-303"}],"id":37702},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"17:15:00","end":"18:05:00","location":"Meyer 144"}],"id":37860},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:05:00","location":"Meyer 144"}],"id":37858}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"}}
