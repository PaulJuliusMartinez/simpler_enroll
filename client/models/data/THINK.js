How does science function as a way of understanding our world, and importantly how does it differ from other approaches? As its point of departure, this course will examine and critique selected episodes of the television series, MythBusters (Discovery Channel), which tests the validity of many popular beliefs in a variety of imaginative ways, including myths, rumors, traditions, and stories. We will take the opportunity to delve more deeply into the applicability of the scientific method in understanding a vast range of real-world problems, and into the practical acquisition of fact-based knowledge, which together form the cornerstone of all science. The intellectual framework of this course will be based, first and foremost, on skeptical inquiry, combined with the other key ingredients of good science, which include:  framing the question well, careful experimental design, meticulous observation and measurement, quantitative analysis and modeling, the evaluation of statistical significance, recovery from failure, disseminating findings, and the continuous cycle of hypothesis and testing. Note: This course is taught at an introductory level, but it pays serious attention to the quantitative treatment of experimental data and associated tests of statistical significance. All students taking the course will be expected to learn, and to work a series of problems in, basic probability and statistics. There is also a hands-on, \"dorm lab\" component that involves some fabrication and a significant amount of individual testing and measurement. The final course project will involve developing and writing a scientific grant proposal to test a myth. We hope to inculcate in our students \"a taste for questioning, a sense of observation, intellectual rigor, practice with reasoning, modesty in the face of facts, the ability to distinguish between true and false, and an attachment to logical and precise language. \" (Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, 2010 Science 330:605).","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-AQR","WAY-SMA"],"id":213213,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"370-370"}],"id":28613}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28618},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28651},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28790},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28650},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28652},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28791},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28649},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"160-321"}],"id":28648}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Through a close reading of key poems, short stories, and films created in this period, this course will identify major inclusionary and exclusionary forces in the process of nation-building in 20th-century Iran. Specific attention will be paid to issues of ethnicity, religion, and gender. In addition to reading texts (poetry and prose) and watching films, students will be called on to present critiques of these literary and cinematic products in the form of brief oral presentations and short writing assignments. The final project will involve interviewing Iranian expatriates on issues covered in the lectures. Students will work in small groups to produce short videos of these interpersonal encounters.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK"],"id":213238,},

But before Facebook, individuals organized themselves in social networks; before Twitter, revolutionaries used media to communicate and coordinate their messages. In fact, even animal societies are networked.  Through project-based exercises, you will learn to study, analyze, and write about networks from the perspectives of a biologist, a computer scientist, and a historian.

The questions that the Civil War addressed - and failed to address - continue to affect our lives today.  We will focus on how Americans negotiated issues of cultural memory and national identity through a close analysis of historical texts, novels, poems, films, paintings, cartoons, photographs, and music.  Our interpretations will foreground the particular themes of race and nationhood, freedom and citizenship, and changing notions of individual and collective identity. Our assumption in this course is that history is not available to us as a set of events - fixed, past, and unchanging. Rather, history is known through each generation's interpretations of those events, and these interpretations are shaped by each generation's lived experience. What stories get told? Whose stories?

Energy use is intricately woven through the fabric of the productive (and comfortable) lives we live in the developed world.  We use energy to move and sometimes make fresh water, grow food, transport it to markets, heat, cool, and light our dwellings and workplaces, communicate and compute, and travel the world.  We worry about energy security and fret about the cost of gasoline.  And as world population continues to grow and the developing world seeks to use energy for the services we enjoy, the challenge of supplying the energy the world needs will grow commensurately.  Energy is also a primary way human activities interact with global air, water, and biological systems that provide essential services to us and the planet.

Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment.  Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century.  The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines.  We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals. You will learn to develop policy briefs addressing sustainability issues in the university, local communities, state and the nation as well as work on team projects with decision makers that address real-life challenges in your local area.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-SMA"],"id":214420,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"Hewlett Teaching Center 102"}],"id":20033}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20094},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20092},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20093},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":20095}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

In this course, we will directly address the questions of why there are so few women leaders and what can be done, at an organizational and individual level, to increase their representation. Using the lens of sociology, we will think critically about leadership, influence, power, status, gender stereotypes, mentorship, and negotiation. Once we understand the mechanisms underpinning the lack of women leaders, we will discuss and critique potential interventions. A unique aspect of this course will be to apply some of the scholarly research on gender and leadership to our lives outside the classroom.

We explore how political thinkers, from Machiavelli to Madison and Mill, used the lessons of ancient politics to design bold new systems of government. Ancient politics may still hold lessons for us. We analyze what is broken in modern government (corruption, polarization, gridlock), how it broke, and how the tool kit of ancient political history might help us to analyze and repair the damage.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-ER","WAY-SI"],"id":215411,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"Lathrop 282"}],"id":20614}]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":30544},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":30543},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":30541},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30049},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"Thornt211"}],"id":30542},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30540}]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

How do these changing medical and cultural representations of the body reflect larger societal shifts? How does illness change our perceptions of our bodies and our identities? Viewed through the lens of medicine, the body is a text that offers clues to health and illness, yet clinical readings are never entirely objective. Culture informs and distorts how we discern, accept, reject, and analyze our bodies. Looking at literary, medical, ethical, and anthropological texts, we ask how representations of the body affects the way we experience illness, embody gender and racial identities, and understand our rights (or lack of rights) to control our own bodies. We will critically examine our perceptions about the body and debate some of the most complex and sensitive issues surrounding the body, from the ethics of medical research trials to end of life decisions.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["THINK","WAY-ED"],"id":215412,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"1:05:00 PM","location":"200-002"}],"id":20615}]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30539},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","location":""}],"id":30537},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":30534},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30538},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","location":""}],"id":30536},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:05:00 PM","location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":30535},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"School of Education 130"}],"id":30050},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:05:00 PM","location":"School of Education 130"}],"id":30533}]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

You will be introduced to the basic theory and art of storytelling, enabling you to understand and master the fundamentals of narrative structure, plot, and character. This will allow you to practice producing your own stories through both interpretative and creative writing assignments.

We explore the relationship between these different ideals through an interdisciplinary inquiry that includes political philosophy, history and law. In your reading, writing and thinking, you will move between the realm of abstract ideas and actual legal cases. We begin with the philosophical roots of the ideals of liberty, equality and security and then focus on their articulation in the US Constitution and the overarching US legal framework and public policy.

At the same time science and technology also entail risks that suggest more dystopian scenarios - in their most extreme form, threats to humanity's very survival. We will look at several works that consider how literary visions of society have evolved with the progress of science and technology.
