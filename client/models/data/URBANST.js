"172":{"department":"URBANST","number":"172","title":"Design Approaches to Mending a City: Rethinking the 101 in East Palo Alto (CEE 134C)","description":"The omnipresence of automobile infrastructure negotiating the urban, suburban, and rural landscapes emphasizes the prioritization of this mode of transportation in the United States. Although the overlap of highway and urban area is sometimes addressed (and re-addressed), it tends to create sub-districts, fragmentation, and unnecessary conditions of separation. nnWhile serving as an important circulation network on the west coast, connecting Los Angeles to Seattle, the infrastructure of Highway 101 cuts through various communities, at times creating division at the local scale.  One of the more marked manifestations of this division is in East Palo Alto, where the highway separates residents on the west side from schools and activities on the east side, acting as a barrier that must be navigated by car. nnThis studio aims to articulate the issues created by the presence of the highway and study design solutions that not only mitigate the presence of these two systems (highway and community) at a general level, but develop strategic approaches to the issues facing the specific area. In this regard, students will engage with the site, community members, and local officials. They will focus on the issues and impact of transportation infrastructure and offer design oriented ideas and responses for addressing the intersection of urban development and highway systems.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":213769,},
