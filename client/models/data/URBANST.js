Take part in real-world design projects in the city of San Francisco and/or other Bay Area communities, while decoding public spaces from multiple perspectives: as sites of recreation, interaction, and political contention; as physical infrastructure that municipalities or grassroots citizen efforts seek to build and maintain for the common good; as places of historical memory, identity, and personal storytelling; and as opportunities for cutting-edge civic innovation. Participants will practice ethical design, utilizing frameworks that are inclusive (for many) and participatory (by many), and that benefit human beings and their diverse communities.

We will develop skills for 1-on-1 relational meetings, media messaging, fundraising strategies, power structure analysis, and strategies organizing across racial/ethnic difference. And we will contextualize these through the theories and practices developed in the racial, gender, queer, environmental, immigrant, housing and economic justice movements to better understand how organizing has been used to engage communities in the process of social change. Through this class, students will gain the hard skills and analytical tools needed to successfully organize campaigns and movements that work to address complex systems of power, privilege, and oppression. As a Community-Engaged Learning course, students will work directly with community organizations on campaigns to address community needs, deepen their knowledge of theory and history through hands-on practice, and develop a critical analysis of inequality at the structural and interpersonal levels. Placements with community organizations are limited. Enrollment will be determined on the first day through a simple application process.

The need for sustainability, so the argument goes, will make cities &iquest;more like Manhattan&iquest; with high-rise clustering, residences close to work, pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and a heavy emphasis on mass transit. But a recent US Census report indicates that center-city urban growth in America has begun to level off while suburbs continue to grow vigorously, and the suburban residential option remains highly attractive both to the established middle-class populations in the advanced industrial nations and to the emerging middle-classes in Asia and Latin America. As a result, the real urban sustainability challenge of the future will be the task of greening the suburbs with the use of mobility policies that are necessarily very different from those needed in dense urban centers. In addition, the automobile industry will face two very different design and marketing challenges &iquest; one for center cities and quite another for more spatially diffuse suburbs.Working together, students in this undergraduate seminar will explore these issues, hear from suburban planners and developers concerned about sustainability challenges, and engage in the re-design of suburbs and suburban mobility options for the future.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213310,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Stout, F."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Stout, F."],"location":""}],"id":45075}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
