Course content will be framed by the creation of the Bill of Rights (ratified in 1791) and the evisceration of the First Amendment in the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the first instance of what historian Richard J. Hofstader famously called \"the paranoid style in American politics.\"  We will explore the 1790s through 1) an examination of the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debates concerning the pros and cons of establishing a national government rather than a confederation of states; 2) the range of American and British responses to the French Revolution; 3) the growth of democratic radicalism in Anglo-America; 4) the fear of radical-democratic infiltration of the United States from the European Continent, Ireland, and Haiti; and 5) the American literary expression of these questions written in the late 1790s, on the cusp of the post-revolutionary and \"early national\" eras.  Our overall goal is to gain a historical understanding of the overlapping cultural contexts for American ¿republicanism,¿ ¿democracy,¿ and ¿liberalism,¿ and the evolution of their meanings.  We will focus particularly on the co-production of democratic and novelistic subjectivity in relation to natural right theory, the evolution of \"conscience,\" voice, the body, individuation, sovereignty, representation, equality, and freedom.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":214380,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"18:05:00","location":"80-115"}],"id":38474}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

While focusing on issues of political meaning and political thought that both inform literary production and are partly shaped by it, the seminar will ask what it means to have a dominant critical paradigm for the understanding of fundamental relations between literary and non-literary (or at least less literary) discourses. Even though we will be studying major Renaissance authors such as Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare, the theoretical and methodological issues the course is designed to raise transcend period boundaries. We will look at recent scholarly production in the field of early modern studies to see how scholars go about defining and positioning their critical agendas in their attempts to offer new or modified conceptions of the relationship between Renaissance literature, and literature more generally, and politics.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":214350,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"18:05:00","location":"160-331"}],"id":38467}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Sometimes a poem or a painting stands out to us, asking that we stay with it, that we remember it, although we cannot exactly say why. Poems have a way of making pictures in the mind, and paintings turn \"rhymes\" amid the people, places, and things they portray. Each is a concentrated world, inviting an exhilarating closeness of response: why does this line come first? Why does the artist include that detail? Who knows but that as we write and talk about these poems and pictures we will be doing what John Keats said a painter does: that is, arriving at a \"trembling delicate and snail-horn perception of Beauty.\" Each week explore the kinship between a different pair of painter and poet and also focuses on a particular problem or method of interpretation. Some of the artist/poet combinations we will consider: Shakespeare and Caravaggio; Jorie Graham and (the photographer) Henri Cartier-Bresson; Alexander Pope and Thomas Gainsborough; William Wordsworth and Caspar David Friedrich; Christina Rossetti and Mary Cassatt; Walt Whitman and Thomas Eakins; Thomas Hardy and Edward Hopper.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["DB-Hum","WAY-AII"],"id":214292,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"17:05:00","location":"240-110"}],"id":38450}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
