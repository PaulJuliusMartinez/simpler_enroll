Many of these works inhere in innovations in literary and artistic forms in order to capture and even evoke the strong cognitive, or psychological, dimension of such &iquest;awakenings.&iquest; The reader, or viewer, is often challenged to adapt her or his mind to new forms of thought, such as John Donne&iquest;s seventeenth century creation of the Dramatic Monologue, a form popular with modern writers, which requires the reader&iquest;s cognitive &iquest;presence&iquest; in order to fill out the dramatic scene. In so doing, the reader often supplies the presence of the female voice and thereby enters into her self-consciousness and inner thoughts. Adrienne Rich, for example, specifically &iquest;rewrites&iquest; one of Donne&iquest;s major poems from the female perspective. This can be, in Rich&iquest;s words, an &iquest;awakening&iquest; for the active reader, as he or she assumes that often-unspoken female perspective. The course will also explore male conceptions of the self and how such conceptions are often grounded in cultural attitudes imposed on male subjects, which can contribute to gender-bias toward women, a subject often neglected in exploring gendered attitudes, but which is now gaining more study, for example, in Shakespeare&iquest;s &iquest;Othello.&iquest; Readings from recent developments in the neurosciences and cognitive studies will be included in our study of artistic forms and how such forms can activate particular mindsets.
