This course uses the rich resources available only in Stanford&iquest;s Special Collections to explore the ideas, sensibilities, and media representations of 1960s countercultures including civil rights, anti-war, back-to-nature environmentalism, the Beats, feminism, hippies, gay liberation, and Black Power.

Sometimes a poem or a painting stands out to us, asking that we stay with it, that we remember it, although we cannot exactly say why. Poems have a way of making pictures in the mind, and paintings turn \"rhymes\" amid the people, places, and things they portray. Each is a concentrated world, inviting an exhilarating closeness of response: why does this line come first? Why does the artist include that detail? Who knows but that as we write and talk about these poems and pictures we will be doing what John Keats said a painter does: that is, arriving at a \"trembling delicate and snail-horn perception of Beauty.\" Each week explore the kinship between a different pair of painter and poet and also focuses on a particular problem or method of interpretation. Some of the artist/poet combinations we will consider: Shakespeare and Caravaggio; Jorie Graham and (the photographer) Henri Cartier-Bresson; Alexander Pope and Thomas Gainsborough; William Wordsworth and Caspar David Friedrich; Christina Rossetti and Mary Cassatt; Walt Whitman and Thomas Eakins; Thomas Hardy and Edward Hopper.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":214292,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Nemerov, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Jenkins, N.","Nemerov, A."],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 370"}],"id":15908}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
