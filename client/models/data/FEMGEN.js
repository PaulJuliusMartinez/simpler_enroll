"209":{"department":"FEMGEN","number":"209","title":"Looking Back, Moving Forward: Raising Critical Awareness in Gender and Sports (FEMGEN 109)","description":"In 1972, Title IX legislation opened up a vast range of opportunities for women in sports. Since then, women's sports have continued to grow yet the fight for recognition and equality persists. Simply put, men's sports are more popular than women's--so much so, in fact, that people often make the hierarchical distinction between \"sports\" and \"women's sports.\" But what would it take to get more women's sports featured on ESPN or more female athletes on the cover of Sports Illustrated? And, given the well-documented corruption at the highest levels of men's sports, should such an ascent in popularity be the goal for women's sports? This course will map out and respond to the multifaceted issues that emerge when women enter the sports world. Throughout the quarter, we will explore the fight for gender equality in sports through historical, cultural, and rhetorical lenses.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":214243,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":19395}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
