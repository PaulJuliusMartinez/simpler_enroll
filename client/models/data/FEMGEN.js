And, given the well-documented corruption at the highest levels of men&#39;s sports, should such an ascent in popularity be the goal for women&#39;s sports?

"52N":{"department":"FEMGEN","number":"52N","title":"Spoken Sexuality: Language and the Social Construction of Sexuality (LINGUIST 52N)","description":"This course, divided into three sections, examines the many ways language is used in the construction of sexuality and sexual identity.  In the first section, we consider how language is used as a resource for performing and perceiving sexual identity.  Drawing on detailed linguistic analyses of pronunciation, word choice, and grammar, we will address questions such as the following:  Is there a gay accent?  Why isn&#39;t there a lesbian accent?  How do transgendered people modify their linguistic behavior when transitioning?  How are unmarked (heterosexual) identities linguistically constructed?  While sexuality is largely an issue of identity, it is also an issue of desire.  In the second section of the course, we examine iconic relations between elements of language (e.g. breathy voice quality, high pitch) and aspects of desire (e.g. arousal, excitement).  In the final section, we investigate ways in which language encodes ideologies about sexuality.  Specifically, we will study how language is used to talk about sexuality in public discourses about gay marriage and bullying, as well as in personal narratives of coming out.  We will also consider how language encodes dominant ideologies about sexuality, evident in labels for sexual minorities as well as terminology for sex acts.  Class activities will center on discussions of readings, explorations of how sexuality is portrayed in popular media, and analyses of primary data.
