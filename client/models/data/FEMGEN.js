We will develop skills for 1-on-1 relational meetings, media messaging, fundraising strategies, power structure analysis, and strategies organizing across racial/ethnic difference. And we will contextualize these through the theories and practices developed in the racial, gender, queer, environmental, immigrant, housing and economic justice movements to better understand how organizing has been used to engage communities in the process of social change. Through this class, students will gain the hard skills and analytical tools needed to successfully organize campaigns and movements that work to address complex systems of power, privilege, and oppression. As a Community-Engaged Learning course, students will work directly with community organizations on campaigns to address community needs, deepen their knowledge of theory and history through hands-on practice, and develop a critical analysis of inequality at the structural and interpersonal levels. Placements with community organizations are limited. Enrollment will be determined on the first day through a simple application process. Students will have the option to continue the course for a second quarter in the Winter, where they will execute a campaign either on campus or in collaboration with their community partner.","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217477,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Murray, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Murray, D."],"location":"160-315"}],"id":30731}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine. Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard.

We will examine engineering cultures and gender through the lens of &iquest;design thinking&iquest;, which is an increasingly visible component of engineering education and practice. Design processes are determined by the designers, their disciplinary backgrounds, and the methods they use. How do the background characteristics of the designer affect products and development in innovation and research? Does gender matter? What about other characteristics of the designer? How can design thinking help to find sustainable solutions and also consider gender and diversity perspectives?","min_units":1,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":217176,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Muller, C."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"8:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Gilmartin, S.","Sheppard, S.","Muller, C."],"location":"160-124"},{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"8:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Muller, C.","Gilmartin, S.","Sheppard, S."],"location":"160-331"}],"id":30361}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

The foundational text, This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga, Anzald&uacute;a, eds.), in its 4th and 2015 edition, will serve as the basis for an intergenerational conversation on U.S. Third World and Transnational and Queer Feminisms with an emphasis on lived experience and the performance of everyday life. Theoretical work will revolve around the concept of &iquest;Theory in the Flesh,&iquest; initially introduced in Bridge in 1981 and its significance to performance theory, queer and feminist theory and political practice.  In addition to Bridge, texts may include recent anthologies on women of color feminisms and the writings by a variety of scholars, e.g. Norma Alarc&oacute;n, Jacqui Alexander, Alicia Arriz&oacute;n, Anne Cheng, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandra Mohanty, Ann Pellegrini, Ram&oacute;n Rivera-Severa, Chela Sandoval & Hortense Spillers. A final project &iquest;performing identity&iquest; as &iquest;theory in the flesh,&iquest; is required, along with a written &iquest;metacommentary.&iquest; As part of the class project students will help organize a campus-wide event, featuring local original contributors to Bridge and offering students the opportunity to exchange &iquest;in the flesh&iquest; with women of color performers, artists, activists and scholars.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":208009,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Menon, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Menon, J."],"location":"Memaud125"}],"id":45870}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
