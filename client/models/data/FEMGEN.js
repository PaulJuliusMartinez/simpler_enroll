Drawing on detailed linguistic analyses of pronunciation, word choice, and grammar, we will address questions such as the following:  Is there a gay accent?  Why isn't there a lesbian accent?  How do transgendered people modify their linguistic behavior when transitioning?  How are unmarked (heterosexual) identities linguistically constructed?nnnWhile sexuality is largely an issue of identity, it is also an issue of desire.  In the second section of the course, we examine iconic relations between elements of language (e.g. breathy voice quality, high pitch) and aspects of desire (e.g. arousal, excitement).nnnIn the final section, we investigate ways in which language encodes ideologies about sexuality.  Specifically, we will study how language is used to talk about sexuality in public discourses about gay marriage and bullying, as well as in personal narratives of coming out.  We will also consider how language encodes dominant ideologies about sexuality, evident in labels for sexual minorities as well as terminology for sex acts.nnnClass activities will center on discussions of readings, explorations of how sexuality is portrayed in popular media, and analyses of primary data.  Students will be expected to write a final research paper on a topic of their choice.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213207,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:30:00"}],"id":38417}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
