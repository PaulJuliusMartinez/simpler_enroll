This makes for complicated relationships with those that are not part of those frontline communities but recognize that their own silence makes them complicit in systems of oppression. In this course, we will examine how power and privilege can undermine attempts to collaborate in social justice work, and then explore principles and practices of solidarity and allyship that attempt to overcome these challenges. We will discuss texts on white privilege and anti-racism as our primary point of reference, but will connect to other kinds of ally work and movements for collective liberation. As a community-engaged learning course, students will work with community partners to establish long-term relationships based in solidarity. Students are encouraged to work with movements and organizations with whom they already have relationships (e.g., through student-activism).

What are the different spaces we can find queer black relationality, eroticism, and kinship?  How do we negotiate issues like trans*misogyny or tensions around gender and sexuality in the context of race?
