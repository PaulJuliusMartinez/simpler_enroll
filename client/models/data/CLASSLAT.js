In this book, our main focus this quarter, we find some of the most famous episodes of Roman legendary history, that, masterfully recounted by Livy, have been looked back to through the centuries as ultimate definitinos of Roman ideals and virtues. What makes Livy's story-telling so compelling? What kind of history did Livy think he was writing? What can we read in these legends about Roman values, self-definition and possibly self-doubt? How differently have moderns understood these episodes in different period? These are the sort of questions that we will be asking while reading the text with close attention to language, style and narrative techniques. Readings in Latin.
