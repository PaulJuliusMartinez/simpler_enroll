"81N":{"department":"PHYSICS","number":"81N","title":"Science on the Back of the Envelope","description":"Understanding the complex world around us quantitatively, using order of magnitude estimates and dimensional analysis. Starting from a handful of fundamental constants of Nature, one can estimate complex quantities such as cosmological length and time scales, size of the atom, height of Mount Everest, speed of tsunami, energy density of fuels and climate effects. Through these examples students learn the art of deductive thinking, fundamentalnnprinciples of science and the beautiful unity of nature.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213284,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:30:00 PM","location":"McCullough 126"}],"id":34840}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
