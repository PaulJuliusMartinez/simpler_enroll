{"200":{"department":"NSUR","number":"200","title":"Narratives in Neurosurgery","description":"Introduces medical, non-medical graduate and undergraduate students to careers in neurosurgery. Focuses on a progressive walk through the educational milestones of a neurosurgical career, starting with perspectives of 4th year medical students and working up to day-to-day functions and lifestyles of senior neurosurgical faculty. Additional topics covered include: global health neurosurgery, private practice neurosurgery, and academic neurosurgery.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215360,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Grant, G."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"5:30:00 PM","end":"6:30:00 PM","instructors":["Grant, G."],"location":"E.D.

Focus on quantifiable models of neural signaling, starting with physical specification of input signals, sensory transductions, spiking, and mean electrical field potentials, and the inter-relation to BOLD signals (fMRI). Also, interactions between electronic devices and the brain (brain-machine interactions) Applications will be drawn from many examples, but a there will be a particular focus on the visual pathways and how measurements and models relate to visual perception.","min_units":1,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":214839,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Wandell, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Wandell, B."],"location":"420-102"}],"id":25989}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

How stroke is studied in the laboratory; advances in stroke research over the last two decades; and future directions. Topics include: cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuronal death and survival in the brain after stroke, including necrosis, apoptosis, inflammation, and cell signaling pathways; experimental tools for stroke treatment, such as gene therapy, cell therapy, hypothermia, preconditioning, postconditioning, and other pharmacological treatments; the gap and barrier between laboratory research and clinical translation.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":208895,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Zhao, H."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Zhao, H."],"location":""}],"id":24378}],[]],"primary_type":"Intro Dial"}}
