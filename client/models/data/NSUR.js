{"200SI":{"department":"NSUR","number":"200SI","title":"Narratives in Neurosurgery","description":"Introduces medical, non-medical graduate and undergraduate students to careers in neurosurgery. Focuses on a progressive walk through the educational milestones of a neurosurgical career, starting with perspectives of 4th year medical students and working up to day-to-day functions and lifestyles of senior neurosurgical faculty. Additional topics covered include: global health neurosurgery, private practice neurosurgery, and academic neurosurgery.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215360,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Grant, G."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"5:30:00 PM","end":"6:30:00 PM","instructors":["Grant, G."],"location":""}],"id":29932}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

This seminar will review methods, principal results, and ideas for designing devices that either act on or read out data from the nervous system. A principal objective of designing these devices is to use them for sensory prosthetics (retinal implants and motor control units), and also for reducing the symptoms of different diseases (Parkinsons, Depression, Epilepsy). We will consider a wide variety of applications, but our emphasis will be on electronic devices that either stimulate or read-out from the human brain.","min_units":1,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":214839,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Wandell, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","instructors":["Wandell, B."],"location":"420-102"}],"id":34062}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

How stroke is studied in the laboratory; advances in stroke research over the last two decades; and future directions. Topics include: cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuronal death and survival in the brain after stroke, including necrosis, apoptosis, inflammation, and cell signaling pathways; experimental tools for stroke treatment, such as gene therapy, cell therapy, hypothermia, preconditioning, postconditioning, and other pharmacological treatments; the gap and barrier between laboratory research and clinical translation.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":208895,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Zhao, H."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"4:04:00 PM","instructors":["Zhao, H."],"location":"CCSR 4107"}],"id":28788}],[]],"primary_type":"Intro Dial"}}
