We will read her song lyrics (ci), the most celebrated form of her writings, as well as several of her poems in the shi form and her various prose writings as well. The singularity of her work as a poet and critic will be brought out through comparison with other writers of her day.nnAttention will also be given to the complicated reception history of her work, from her own day down through late imperial times and into the twentieth century. This history is inseparable from controversies surrounding her conduct and changing notions of womanly virtue in the Ming-Qing period. The legacy of those notions even in modern representations of Li Qingzhao will also be analyzed.nnClass meets in Knight Bldg, Rm 102.","min_units":2,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":216944,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Egan, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Egan, R."],"location":""}],"id":28721}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"274":{"department":"CHINLIT","number":"274","title":"Modern Chinese Novel: Theory, Aesthetics, History (COMPLIT 254)","description":"By reading theories of fiction along with 5 representative Chinese novels, the course explores the individual&iquest;s relationships to the moral fabric of family, community, and society. In the transition from the traditional culture to the modern world, the traditional moral order was dismantled.  Yet strands of old morality persist and are revitalized into new moral imperatives. The modern Chinese novel will be a prism to comprehend the critique and novelization of the moral norms in the formation of modern subjectivity.  The theoretical half of the course includes Taylor&iquest;s Sources of the Self, Slaughter&iquest;s Human Rights, Inc., Marston Anderson&iquest;s Limits of Realism, and works by Chinese theorists.  We will read fictions by Wu Woyao, Mao Dun, Ding Ling, Zhang Rong, and Yu Hua. This course will be part of the workshop &iquest;Moral Reform, Public Virtue, and Literature,&iquest; sponsored by Stanford&iquest;s McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society. Speakers will be invited to present their work.
