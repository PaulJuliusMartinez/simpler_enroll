Beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing through the 1990s, we will focus our inquiry on a number of notorious cases, some associated with familiar names&iquest;the &iquest;Scottsboro Boys,&iquest; Emmett Till, O.J. Simpson&iquest;others involving once-infamous actors&iquest;like Joan Little and Inez Garcia&iquest;whose ordeals have receded into historical memory, considering a range of questions arising from this thematic nexus. For instance, in what ways are sexual transgressions racialized and gendered? What are the practical and theoretical ramifications of the seemingly inextricable conjunction of sex and violence in legal and popular discourse? And what insights might such spectacles afford when broached as an arena in which sexual meanings, identities, and practices are refracted and ultimately constructed? We will also examine the role of the pertinent professions in the evolution of these events, in particular how the interplay of law, medicine, psychiatry, and forensic science helped define the shifting boundaries of legality, and how print, radio, and television journalism operated not only in sensationalizing, but also in reflecting, modeling, and shaping prevailing attitudes and behaviors. Our study of this vital facet of our &iquest;society of the spectacle&iquest; will draw on a series of compelling secondary readings complemented by a diverse array of primary sources&iquest;from contemporaneous pamphlets and newspaper accounts to photographs, letters, trial testimony, and psychological commentary&iquest;that will enable class members to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different textual genres, experiment with alternative methods of fashioning historical interpretations, and contemplate the ways history might be employed to illuminate the persistent problems of racial bias, reflexive sexualization, and the packaging of trials as mass entertainment in the present day.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217505,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"location":"160-B39"}],"id":46283}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

In late fall 2014,in the aftermath of the police-involved killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, society is confronted with a radically different social and political landscape. Yet events like these, while doubtless underscoring the fallaciousness of the equalitarian narrative, are regrettably commonplace. What, if anything, occurred during the intervening years that might explain the apparent displacement of hope by despair? With the advent of the Black Lives Matte movement, the persistence of bias and discrimination against people of color, particularly at the interface of African American males and law enforcement authorities, has attained a place of prominence on the public agenda, presenting a significant opportunity for citizen-activists, legislators, and policymakers to combine forces to effectuate meaningful change. To take advantage of this moment, it is imperative to understand the origins and development of the entrenched structural inequalities manifest in contemporary America. What role have law and legal institutions played in hindering and facilitating the promise of equality for all citizens? How far are we from realizing that vaunted democratic aspiration? This course offers participants an opportunity to systematically engage with recent events in Baltimore, Ferguson, and elsewhere in an historically informed manner that foregrounds questions of race, citizenship, and law. Against the backdrop of the achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, it considers such topics as the rise of urban ghettos and the use of segregationist practices like redlining and steering in helping to sustain them; resegregation in the late 20th-early 21st century; differential arrest and sentencing patterns; and, crucially, the extraordinary growth of the American carceral state.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217506,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 350"}],"id":47392}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
