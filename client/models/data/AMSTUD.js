In this context, how do museums create experiences that teach visitors about who they are and about the world around them? What are the politics of representation that shape learning in these environments? Using an experimental instructional approach, students will reconsider and redefine what it means to curate experience.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AII","WAY-ED"],"id":214597,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"12:50:00"}],"id":58565}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

How does literature provide a particular medium for not only self expression, but also for meditations on what goes into the construction of \"the Self\"?

Our course focuses in particular on this question--Does this universal issue (\"who am I\") become skewed differently when we add a qualifier before it, like \"ethnic\"?","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["DB-Hum","WAY-AII","WAY-ED","Writing 2"],"id":211453,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:30:00"}],"id":33354}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
