"61":{"department":"UAR","number":"61","title":"Religion and Identity","description":"This one-unit course will focus on issues of religion and identity, especially as it relates to what our religious commitments (whether strong, weak, or non-existent) mean for our social and political engagement with society at large.  This will be a student-driven, conversation-heavy course.  The experiences of the students in the class will help shape the exact nature of the questions we explore together.  After getting to know each other at the first session, we will use short articles to organize our discussion for the rest of the class meetings.  Possible conversation starters include: the debate over the hijab in French public schools, altered states and religious freedom in the US, Buddhism and political violence in Myanmar, gay marriage and civil disobedience in the US.  The course will meet from 3:30-5 on alternating Fridays (weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) in the SLE Office in Florence Moore Hall.
