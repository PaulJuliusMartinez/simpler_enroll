Using an innovative combination of online lectures by Stanford faculty and recorded interviews with Indigenous Peoples and other stakeholders in cultural heritage disputes, it will explore current laws and practices at national and international levels concerning the removal, repatriation, revival and conservation of Indigenous cultural heritage. It will also critically examine the theoretical basis for those laws and practices, and consider challenges and avenues for furthering protection of the cultural heritage rights promised in UNDRIP.  As part of that discussion, the seminar will cover the historical context of removal, survival and revival of Indigenous cultural heritage; past and present museum approaches to display, conservation and repatriation; and optimal methods of resolving repatriation disputes.  While case studies will cover primarily the situation of Indigenous Peoples in North America, comparisons will be drawn with other regions of the globe.
