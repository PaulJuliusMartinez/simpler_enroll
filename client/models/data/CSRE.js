We will develop skills for 1-on-1 relational meetings, media messaging, fundraising strategies, power structure analysis, and strategies organizing across racial/ethnic difference. And we will contextualize these through the theories and practices developed in the racial, gender, queer, environmental, immigrant, housing and economic justice movements to better understand how organizing has been used to engage communities in the process of social change. Through this class, students will gain the hard skills and analytical tools needed to successfully organize campaigns and movements that work to address complex systems of power, privilege, and oppression. As a Community-Engaged Learning course, students will work directly with community organizations on campaigns to address community needs, deepen their knowledge of theory and history through hands-on practice, and develop a critical analysis of inequality at the structural and interpersonal levels. Placements with community organizations are limited. Enrollment will be determined on the first day through a simple application process. Students will have the option to continue the course for a second quarter in the Winter, where they will execute a campaign either on campus or in collaboration with their community partner.","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217477,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Murray, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Murray, D."],"location":"160-315"}],"id":30401}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Murray, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Murray, D."],"location":"School of Education 130"}],"id":31291}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

Sentencing is the process by which criminal sanctions are imposed in individual cases following criminal convictions. Corrections deals with the implementation and evaluation of criminal sentences after they are handed down. In fact, the two subject areas are inseparable. The course will examine sentencing and corrections from global and historical views, from theoretical and policy perspectives, and with close attention to many problem-specific areas. We will explore sentencing theories and their application, the nature, scope and function of corrections, the impact of mass incarceration on crime and communities, the effectiveness of rehabilitation, the relationship between sanctions and crime, and the consequences of prisoner reentry. These topics will be considered as they play out in current political and policy debates. Guest lectures may include presentations by legal professionals, victims, offenders, and correctional leaders. We also plan to visit a correctional facility. This course is open to 1Ls, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School.

In this course we will explore a deepening societal intrigue with genetic accounts of personal identity and political meaning.  Students will engage with varied interdisciplinary sources that range from legal cases to scientific articles, medical ethics guidelines, films, and anthropological works (ethnographies).  We will explore several case studies where the use of DNA markers (as proof of heritage, disease risk, or legal standing) has spawned cultural movements that are biosocial in nature.  Throughout we will look at how new social movements are organized around gene-based definitions of personhood, health, and legal truth. Several examples include political analyses of citizenship and belonging.  On this count we will discuss issues of African ancestry testing as evidence in slavery reparations cases, revisit debates on whether Black Freedman should be allowed into the Cherokee and Seminole Nations, and hear arguments on whether people with genetic links to Jewish groups should have a right of return to Israel.

Topics include education, the body, sexuality, violence, labor, and politics.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-SI", "WAY-A-II"],"id":215490,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Freedman, E."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Freedman, E."],"location":"200-201"}],"id":43031}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

Beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing through the 1990s, we will focus our inquiry on a number of notorious cases, some associated with familiar names&iquest;the &iquest;Scottsboro Boys,&iquest; Emmett Till, O.J. Simpson&iquest;others involving once-infamous actors&iquest;like Joan Little and Inez Garcia&iquest;whose ordeals have receded into historical memory, considering a range of questions arising from this thematic nexus. For instance, in what ways are sexual transgressions racialized and gendered? What are the practical and theoretical ramifications of the seemingly inextricable conjunction of sex and violence in legal and popular discourse? And what insights might such spectacles afford when broached as an arena in which sexual meanings, identities, and practices are refracted and ultimately constructed? We will also examine the role of the pertinent professions in the evolution of these events, in particular how the interplay of law, medicine, psychiatry, and forensic science helped define the shifting boundaries of legality, and how print, radio, and television journalism operated not only in sensationalizing, but also in reflecting, modeling, and shaping prevailing attitudes and behaviors. Our study of this vital facet of our &iquest;society of the spectacle&iquest; will draw on a series of compelling secondary readings complemented by a diverse array of primary sources&iquest;from contemporaneous pamphlets and newspaper accounts to photographs, letters, trial testimony, and psychological commentary&iquest;that will enable class members to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different textual genres, experiment with alternative methods of fashioning historical interpretations, and contemplate the ways history might be employed to illuminate the persistent problems of racial bias, reflexive sexualization, and the packaging of trials as mass entertainment in the present day.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217505,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"location":"160-B39"}],"id":58074}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Is racial science always racist science?  How do ideas about race intersect with ideas about gender, class, and disability?  This course explores how natural philosophers and scientists have defined, used, and sometimes challenged ideas about race from the eighteenth century to today.

We spend time critically examining the philosophies and works of Black artists including James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, RZA (Wu-Tang Clan) and Nayyirah Waheed, in order to explore new visions for the artist as activist, as futurist and as spiritual healer.  We then use a mixture of these ideas and our own&iquest;along with meditation and mindfulness experiences&iquest;to begin conjuring and manifesting intimate relationships with our art practice and ourselves. Student-artists will develop creative confidence, formulate game plans for success, and begin to find balance between the uncertainty and ultimate freedom that life as an artist can bring.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217490,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Holt, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Holt, A."],"location":""}],"id":30494}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"81":{"department":"CSRE","number":"81","title":"Race and the Law: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (AMSTUD 108)","description":"When Obama began his presidential tenure in 2009, many commentators declared the U.S. a truly colorblind society, a place where race (read: non-whiteness) no longer served as an impediment to individual and group aspirations, indeed had become so insignificant as to be practically invisible. In late fall 2014,in the aftermath of the police-involved killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, society is confronted with a radically different social and political landscape. Yet events like these, while doubtless underscoring the fallaciousness of the equalitarian narrative, are regrettably commonplace. What, if anything, occurred during the intervening years that might explain the apparent displacement of hope by despair? With the advent of the Black Lives Matte movement, the persistence of bias and discrimination against people of color, particularly at the interface of African American males and law enforcement authorities, has attained a place of prominence on the public agenda, presenting a significant opportunity for citizen-activists, legislators, and policymakers to combine forces to effectuate meaningful change. To take advantage of this moment, it is imperative to understand the origins and development of the entrenched structural inequalities manifest in contemporary America. What role have law and legal institutions played in hindering and facilitating the promise of equality for all citizens? How far are we from realizing that vaunted democratic aspiration? This course offers participants an opportunity to systematically engage with recent events in Baltimore, Ferguson, and elsewhere in an historically informed manner that foregrounds questions of race, citizenship, and law. Against the backdrop of the achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, it considers such topics as the rise of urban ghettos and the use of segregationist practices like redlining and steering in helping to sustain them; resegregation in the late 20th-early 21st century; differential arrest and sentencing patterns; and, crucially, the extraordinary growth of the American carceral state.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217506,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Cardyn, L."],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 350"}],"id":57690}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
