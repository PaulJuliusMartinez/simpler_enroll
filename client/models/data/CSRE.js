We will develop skills for 1-on-1 relational meetings, media messaging, fundraising strategies, power structure analysis, and strategies organizing across racial/ethnic difference. And we will contextualize these through the theories and practices developed in the racial, gender, queer, environmental, immigrant, housing and economic justice movements to better understand how organizing has been used to engage communities in the process of social change. Through this class, students will gain the hard skills and analytical tools needed to successfully organize campaigns and movements that work to address complex systems of power, privilege, and oppression. As a Community-Engaged Learning course, students will work directly with community organizations on campaigns to address community needs, deepen their knowledge of theory and history through hands-on practice, and develop a critical analysis of inequality at the structural and interpersonal levels. Placements with community organizations are limited. Enrollment will be determined on the first day through a simple application process. Students will have the option to continue the course for a second quarter in the Winter, where they will execute a campaign either on campus or in collaboration with their community partner.","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217477,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Murray, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Murray, D."],"location":"160-315"}],"id":30401}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":31291}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

In this course we will explore a deepening societal intrigue with genetic accounts of personal identity and political meaning.  Students will engage with varied interdisciplinary sources that range from legal cases to scientific articles, medical ethics guidelines, films, and anthropological works (ethnographies).  We will explore several case studies where the use of DNA markers (as proof of heritage, disease risk, or legal standing) has spawned cultural movements that are biosocial in nature.  Throughout we will look at how new social movements are organized around gene-based definitions of personhood, health, and legal truth. Several examples include political analyses of citizenship and belonging.  On this count we will discuss issues of African ancestry testing as evidence in slavery reparations cases, revisit debates on whether Black Freedman should be allowed into the Cherokee and Seminole Nations, and hear arguments on whether people with genetic links to Jewish groups should have a right of return to Israel. We will also examine the ways genetic knowledge may shape different health politics at the individual and societal level. On this count we will do close readings of how personal genomics testing companies operate, we will investigate how health disparities funding as well as orphan disease research take on new valences when re-framed in genetic terms, and we will see how new articulations of global health priorities are emerging through genetic research in places like Africa.  Finally we will explore social implications of forensic uses of DNA.  Here we will examine civil liberties concerns about genetic familial searching in forensic databases that disproportionately target specific minority groups as criminal suspects, and inquire into the use of DNA to generate digital mugshots of suspects that re-introduce genetic concepts of race.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI", "WAY-ED"],"id":216607,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Fullwiley, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"6:00:00 PM","end":"8:50:00 PM","instructors":["Fullwiley, D."],"location":"50-51B"}],"id":46576}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

How does our sense of self interact with those around us? How does literature provide a particular medium for not only self expression, but also for meditations on what goes into the construction of \"the Self\"? After all, don't we tell stories in response to the question, \"who are you\"? Besides a list of nouns and names and attributes, we give our lives flesh and blood in telling how we process the world. Our course focuses in particular on this question--Does this universal issue (\"who am I\") become skewed differently when we add a qualifier before it, like \"ethnic\"?","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum", "Writing 2", "WAY-ED"],"id":211453,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Palumbo-Liu, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Palumbo-Liu, D."],"location":""}],"id":45920}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

We spend time critically examining the philosophies and works of Black artists including James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, RZA (Wu-Tang Clan) and Nayyirah Waheed, in order to explore new visions for the artist as activist, as futurist and as spiritual healer.  We then use a mixture of these ideas and our own&iquest;along with meditation and mindfulness experiences&iquest;to begin conjuring and manifesting intimate relationships with our art practice and ourselves.
