How does our sense of self interact with those around us? How does literature provide a particular medium for not only self expression, but also for meditations on what goes into the construction of \"the Self\"? After all, don't we tell stories in response to the question, \"who are you\"? Besides a list of nouns and names and attributes, we give our lives flesh and blood in telling how we process the world. Our course focuses in particular on this question--Does this universal issue (\"who am I\") become skewed differently when we add a qualifier before it, like \"ethnic\"?","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["DB-Hum","WAY-A-II","WAY-ED","Writing 2"],"id":211453,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"11:30:00 AM","location":"260-244"}],"id":33226}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
