"249":{"department":"MKTG","number":"249","title":"MSx: Marketing","description":"Every business has two kinds of problems: 1) Not having customers and 2) everything else. Marketing addresses the first problem. With increased access to information and fast-changing technology the role of marketing has broadened significantly. To attract and retain profitable customers, managers must identify and measure consumers' needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets, and then develop multi-faceted marketing programs that satisfy consumers' needs better than the competition. The objective of this class is to provide you with perspectives on classical and modern day marketing, and to teach you how to take a high level strategic approach towards contemporary marketing challenges.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":100772,},
"335":{"department":"MKTG","number":"335","title":"Product Launch","description":"Our focus is on the question, \"When launching a product, what are the framing issues that will help determine success?\" In particular, we will provide you with tools to analyze market situations and determine whether it makes sense to launch a product or engage in a marketing-related investment. The course is not designed to cover issues such as execution of a strategy (although we will touch on this a bit), but on whether to enter a market to begin with. Thus, the course is decision oriented; we want you to think about market entry decisions and how you would make them. The tools that you will be provided won't consist of equations; instead, we'll arm you with a set of questions to ask, whose answers will help you make better decisions.nnnThis course is an advanced applications marketing course. Unlike the base core course that is designed to cover every basic topic in marketing, here we focus on a number of basic questions and explore them in depth. Although we will have some lectures for background, the bulk of this endeavor will be accomplished through case discussions. In other words, we can't and won't cover everything, as this course is not designed to be comprehensive. We are going to rely on your academic background in marketing to cover the basics; here and there, it is possible that some material will be a review of what you've done before (there's nothing wrong with a little de ja vu). Unfortunately, due to the tight schedule we will not be able to cover any of the basics that are not already included in the course material.nnThe course includes, cases, lectures, and guest lectures.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212614,},
"344":{"department":"MKTG","number":"344","title":"Marketing Research","description":"Market intelligence is of value to firms. To understand their markets, firms need to answer questions such as: How large is the market for a product, what is important for the target segment? How does change in the product design affect profits? This course aims to help students ask relevant questions and find data-driven answers to them. The main objectives are to equip students with: 1) an understanding of the value of data - what intelligence it can and cannot provide, 2) exposure to state-of-the-art quantitative tools such as conjoint analysis and cluster analysis to analyze the data, and 3) sufficient hands-on experience with these tools for answering students' own marketing research questions from the perspective of an entrepreneur, marketer or a consultant. The course is designed to address substantive marketing problems such as: market segmentation, targeting, forecasting demand, pricing, and developing new products. We will use a mix of lectures, exercises, cases and a project to learn the material.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":100957,},
"353":{"department":"MKTG","number":"353","title":"Social Brands","description":"As savvy consumers are increasingly participating in brands rather than merely receiving their messages, how do leading organizations stoke conversations, co-create experiences and stories, and build engaging relationships with consumers? Moreover, how do they harness social media to build a brand, and empower employees and consumers to share these brand stories with others?n nSocial Brands is a hands-on, project-based course that will draw brain power from the GSB, School of Engineering, and other Stanford graduate programs to collaboratively and creatively explore these questions. While we examine various inspiring examples of social brands, we will find that the rules are yet to be written. This emerging genre of social commerce and marketing is the \"Wild West\" and students working in mixed teams will be challenged to design and launch their own social experiments to form their own hypotheses. n nAssignments will push student teams to audit a brand, focus on a strategic goal, and design a social interaction that invites people on campus to participate in an extraordinary personal experience with that brand. Teams will then capture this experience in short videos and compile them into a story -- one that highlights the brand experience they orchestrated, its impact, and their key learnings. This course will integrate approaches from the d.school and marketing curriculum - including brand strategy, storytelling fundamentals, human-centered methods, rapid prototyping, and a bias toward action. This is a class for those that want to learn by doing and creating.nnMKTG 353 - Social Brands class website: http://www.stanford.edu/class/mktg353/","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":210980,},

It's not.nnnWhat we think drives our happiness often doesn't. So what does? And how can knowing this help us create strong companies and brands?nnnUnderstanding happiness is crucial to building successful relationships, products, and organizations. Yet recent research suggests that our definition of happiness is often confused and misguided. In this class, we explore new data on happiness, focusing on:nnnre-thinking happiness (a happy you)nndesigning happiness (a happy company)nnspreading happiness (a happy brand)nnnStudents will work together to use an iterative design-thinking approach to understand our own definitions of happiness, uncover what really makes us happy (vs. what we think makes us happy), prototype solutions/products to increase our happiness, and design happy companies and brands. The class will be data-driven, drawing on multiple methodologies both quantitative and ethnographic. Throughout the quarter, students will build a class-wide database to investigate real-world happiness data via an Designing Happiness app, and test hypotheses about what truly makes them, their teams and their customers happy. This class is recommended for students who plan to be a future entrepreneur building a strong brand, an employee who finds meaning in their work, or someone who wants to understand happiness.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":212091,},
"365":{"department":"MKTG","number":"365","title":"Marketing Analytics","description":"Firms operate in an increasingly challenging business environment, with greater competition, more informed customers and rapidly changing market trends. Simultaneously, they also have access to more information about their customers, the marketplace and their competitors than ever before. In this environment, knowing how to use this information to make optimal business decisions is a crucial competitive advantage. Firms often have access to data that they do not know how to use. The objectives of this course are to introduce students to state-of-the-art marketing analytics and to teach them how to practically apply these analytics to real-world business decisions.nnThe following are examples of the types of questions that the course will address: How should a firm determine the prices for its products and services? What is the effect of television advertising on a brand's sales and how should advertising be optimized? What can a firm learn about its customers from online browsing behavior and how can this knowledge be used for targeted advertising and promotions? How should a firm allocate its sales force? How should a firm manage the allocation of its promotional budget in order to maximize its returns? How should the mailing of catalogs or direct mail be targeted to increase response rates?nnThe course will use a mix of lectures, cases, homework assignments and a course project to learn the material. Students do not need to have an advanced statistical background to take this course. Familiarity with the material in an introductory marketing course and an introductory statistics course will be assumed, but necessary material will be reviewed during the course of the quarter as necessary.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":208939,},
"373":{"department":"MKTG","number":"373","title":"Monetization - Choosing a Business Model","description":"This course examines the fundamental issues of creating a strategy for monetization and revenue growth within an organization. Students learn about setting an organization's business model design, aligning various functional areas within the company to implement a monetization strategy, and the tradeoffs that occur when choosing amongst profitable monetization policies for the firm. They master concepts, frameworks, and tools to assess an industry and a firm's pricing strategy and business models, and to craft alternatives. They also study the interplay between marketing, salesforces, HR incentives and human capital management, advertising and data and analytics in shaping a winning monetization policy. Topics we will cover include monetizing online content and strategies in ad-driven industries, understanding freemium models and installed-base competition, monetization of consumer data, privacy considerations and the privacy economy, business models from the perspective of investors and venture capitalists, regulatory considerations, and linking monetization to the ability to measure and capture value. We will use a mix of cases and lectures along with extensive participation from industry leaders to bring to light the various issues in class.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":216228,},
"375":{"department":"MKTG","number":"375","title":"Consumer Behavior","description":"Contemporary approaches to marketing emphasize the importance of adopting a consumer focus, from determining consumers' wants and needs to shaping their attitudes and ensuring their loyalty.  This course provides insight into consumer psychology and the means by which consumer behavior can be influenced or altered. The course has both theoretical and practical objectives in that it will: (1) explore theory and research that is relevant to understanding consumer psychology and behavior, and (2) apply these theories and findings to generate ideas for developing effective marketing techniques and tactics. By shedding light on the psychological underpinnings of consumers' thoughts, attitudes, preferences, needs, and decision-making styles, this course will help students make more insightful and effective marketing decisions. Moreover, because this course takes a broad psychological perspective, it highlights novel ideas for grabbing attention, shaping behavior, and changing people's minds both within and outside of traditional marketing contexts.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":203614,}}
