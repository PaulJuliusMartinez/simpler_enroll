In each case, we will examine the cultural contexts in which each text was composed (e.g. political regimes and ideologies; attitudes towards gender and sexuality; hierarchies of class and status; discourses on &quot;barbarians&quot; and resident aliens). We will study various theoretical approaches to these books in an effort to &quot;rethink&quot; these texts in the 21st century.","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"09:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}]}]]}}
