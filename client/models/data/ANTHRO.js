The Peruvian Andes is a rich cultural area in South America the first generations of Andean state societies developed. Beginning in  Formative times with Chavin Culture we have an important development of different forms of state from theocratic to military, and most importantly, the Inca Empire. This richness and diversity of state societies was a consequence of an interesting relationship between societies of different levels of development,  economies, and of course, the related diverse ecologies of the region. In 1532, Spanish conquerors came to the Inca Empire and introduced their new vision of politics and economics, and created corresponding new institutions in the Andes. The ensuing colonial age had an interesting development and brought new tensions to this New World. Native ways of work and thought survive in colonial times, creating a distinctive political and ideological scenario including deep ethnic and economic differences. These political tensions established the foundations for revolutionary movements based in indigenous belief as for example &iquest;Taky Onkoy&iquest; (dancing sickness) or &iquest;Neo-Incanism&iquest;. Finally, with independence from Spain, a new republic is established from Lima but many problems in the native structures conditioned the development of new liberal politics.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217393,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":29925}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
