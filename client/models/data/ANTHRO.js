Beginning in  Formative times with Chavin Culture we have an important development of different forms of state from theocratic to military, and most importantly, the Inca Empire. This richness and diversity of state societies was a consequence of an interesting relationship between societies of different levels of development,  economies, and of course, the related diverse ecologies of the region. In 1532, Spanish conquerors came to the Inca Empire and introduced their new vision of politics and economics, and created corresponding new institutions in the Andes. The ensuing colonial age had an interesting development and brought new tensions to this New World. Native ways of work and thought survive in colonial times, creating a distinctive political and ideological scenario including deep ethnic and economic differences. These political tensions established the foundations for revolutionary movements based in indigenous belief as for example &iquest;Taky Onkoy&iquest; (dancing sickness) or &iquest;Neo-Incanism&iquest;.

The course examines the various attempts that have been made over recent decades to find a synthesis between cultural and biological evolution. These approaches, often termed neo-Darwinian, include memes, dual inheritance theory, theories of cultural selection and transmission, niche construction theory and macro-evolutionary approaches. Research in all these areas will be examined, with particular reference to explanations for the origins of agriculture, but also including other transformations, and critiqued. New research in epigenetics offers an alternative non-Darwinian evolutionary perspective that avoids many of the problems and pitfalls in the neo-Darwinian approaches. Cultural evolution comes to be viewed as cumulative, directional and Lamarckian, since heritable epigenetic variation can underlie evolutionary change. Epigenetics opens the way for human cultural entanglements to become the drivers for evolutionary change, thus allowing the full range of social processes studied in the social and cultural sciences to take their place in the study and analysis of long-term change.","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217148,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hodder, I."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hodder, I."],"location":"500-106"}],"id":46950}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Communities have altered their landscapes for a variety of reasons, including the subsistence practices; as a consequence of economic growth; to express a social ideology, and as a consequence of political and religious drivers. Accordingly, landscapes enable physical and provide psychological sustenance to people, and the human need to relate to our surroundings is part of the way in which identities are created and disputed. Within the humanities, landscape is being conceptualized as a process, a practice and as performance, and monuments within a given landscape have an equally important role, not to mention history. They are often the most durable and well-known evidence of the ancient civilizations, and should be observed jointly with the landscape. How did the landscape predefine the monument and how did the monument complement, emphasize or devalue the landscape? What philosophy channeled the construction of the monuments within the landscapes? Whether ephemeral or permanent, the human agency left traces in the landscape; thus, both monuments and landscapes are the key indicators for understanding the ideology of a particular culture. Archaeology, through its interdisciplinary nature, provides a unique perspective, as well as tools, for examining the formation processes of all man-made elements, within both natural and cultural landscapes. nnThe course will address the multifaceted issues of the ways that people have consciously and unconsciously shaped the land around them through time. It will look into diverse, geographically and periodically influenced concepts of a monument and landscape.

The course examines the various attempts that have been made over recent decades to find a synthesis between cultural and biological evolution. These approaches, often termed neo-Darwinian, include memes, dual inheritance theory, theories of cultural selection and transmission, niche construction theory and macro-evolutionary approaches. Research in all these areas will be examined, with particular reference to explanations for the origins of agriculture, but also including other transformations, and critiqued. New research in epigenetics offers an alternative non-Darwinian evolutionary perspective that avoids many of the problems and pitfalls in the neo-Darwinian approaches. Cultural evolution comes to be viewed as cumulative, directional and Lamarckian, since heritable epigenetic variation can underlie evolutionary change. Epigenetics opens the way for human cultural entanglements to become the drivers for evolutionary change, thus allowing the full range of social processes studied in the social and cultural sciences to take their place in the study and analysis of long-term change.","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217148,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hodder, I."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hodder, I."],"location":"500-106"}],"id":46951}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Communities have altered their landscapes for a variety of reasons, including the subsistence practices; as a consequence of economic growth; to express a social ideology, and as a consequence of political and religious drivers. Accordingly, landscapes enable physical and provide psychological sustenance to people, and the human need to relate to our surroundings is part of the way in which identities are created and disputed. Within the humanities, landscape is being conceptualized as a process, a practice and as performance, and monuments within a given landscape have an equally important role, not to mention history. They are often the most durable and well-known evidence of the ancient civilizations, and should be observed jointly with the landscape. How did the landscape predefine the monument and how did the monument complement, emphasize or devalue the landscape? What philosophy channeled the construction of the monuments within the landscapes? Whether ephemeral or permanent, the human agency left traces in the landscape; thus, both monuments and landscapes are the key indicators for understanding the ideology of a particular culture. Archaeology, through its interdisciplinary nature, provides a unique perspective, as well as tools, for examining the formation processes of all man-made elements, within both natural and cultural landscapes. nnThe course will address the multifaceted issues of the ways that people have consciously and unconsciously shaped the land around them through time.

The experiences of Hispanic immigrants and the struggle to escape gang life in Los Angeles are highlighted in the story of Homeboy Industries a job creation program initiated by a priest working in LA's most deadly neighborhoods (G-Dog and the Homeboys by Celeste Fremon). Finally in Searching for Whitopia: an improbable journeyninto the heart of White America, Rich Benjamin explores the creation on ethnic enclaves (whitopias) as fear over immigration and the shrinking white majority redefine race consciousnessnin the 21st century.

We need to critique precisely that which we value, and to ask some hard questions, among them these: What are the differences among humanitarianism, charity, and philanthropy? What of social obligations and solidarities? How does the neoliberal world order currently create structural inequalities that ensure the reproduction of poverty and violence? How does the current order of things resemble or differ from the colonial world order?

In this course we will explore a deepening societal intrigue with genetic accounts of personal identity and political meaning.  Students will engage with varied interdisciplinary sources that range from legal cases to scientific articles, medical ethics guidelines, films, and anthropological works (ethnographies).  We will explore several case studies where the use of DNA markers (as proof of heritage, disease risk, or legal standing) has spawned cultural movements that are biosocial in nature.  Throughout we will look at how new social movements are organized around gene-based definitions of personhood, health, and legal truth. Several examples include political analyses of citizenship and belonging.  On this count we will discuss issues of African ancestry testing as evidence in slavery reparations cases, revisit debates on whether Black Freedman should be allowed into the Cherokee and Seminole Nations, and hear arguments on whether people with genetic links to Jewish groups should have a right of return to Israel. We will also examine the ways genetic knowledge may shape different health politics at the individual and societal level. On this count we will do close readings of how personal genomics testing companies operate, we will investigate how health disparities funding as well as orphan disease research take on new valences when re-framed in genetic terms, and we will see how new articulations of global health priorities are emerging through genetic research in places like Africa.  Finally we will explore social implications of forensic uses of DNA.  Here we will examine civil liberties concerns about genetic familial searching in forensic databases that disproportionately target specific minority groups as criminal suspects, and inquire into the use of DNA to generate digital mugshots of suspects that re-introduce genetic concepts of race.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI", "WAY-ED"],"id":216607,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Evans, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"6:00:00 PM","end":"8:50:00 PM","instructors":["Evans, B.","Fullwiley, D."],"location":"380-380W"}],"id":46575}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar","secondary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Evans, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"7:30:00 PM","end":"8:50:00 PM","instructors":["Evans, B."],"location":"420-050"}],"id":58158},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Moots, H."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"7:30:00 PM","end":"8:50:00 PM","instructors":["Moots, H."],"location":"380-381U"}],"id":58160},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Soon-Shiong, N."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"7:30:00 PM","end":"8:50:00 PM","instructors":["Soon-Shiong, N."],"location":"420-245"}],"id":58159}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},
