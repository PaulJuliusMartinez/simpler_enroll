The Peruvian Andes is a rich cultural area in South America the first generations of Andean state societies developed. Beginning in  Formative times with Chavin Culture we have an important development of different forms of state from theocratic to military, and most importantly, the Inca Empire. This richness and diversity of state societies was a consequence of an interesting relationship between societies of different levels of development,  economies, and of course, the related diverse ecologies of the region. In 1532, Spanish conquerors came to the Inca Empire and introduced their new vision of politics and economics, and created corresponding new institutions in the Andes. The ensuing colonial age had an interesting development and brought new tensions to this New World. Native ways of work and thought survive in colonial times, creating a distinctive political and ideological scenario including deep ethnic and economic differences. These political tensions established the foundations for revolutionary movements based in indigenous belief as for example &iquest;Taky Onkoy&iquest; (dancing sickness) or &iquest;Neo-Incanism&iquest;. Finally, with independence from Spain, a new republic is established from Lima but many problems in the native structures conditioned the development of new liberal politics.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217393,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"380-381T"}],"id":29925}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

How do people who live at the extremes of American society- the super rich, the working poor and those who live on the margins, imagine and experience \"the good life\"? How do we understand phenomena such as gang cultures, addiction and the realignment of white consciousness? This class uses the methods and modes of ethnographic study in an examination of American culture. Ethnographic materials range from an examination of the new American wealth boom of the last 20 years (Richistan by Robert Frank) to the extreme and deadlynworld of the invisible underclass of homeless addicts on the streets of San Francisco (Righteous Dopefiend by Phillipe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg). The experiences of Hispanic immigrants and the struggle to escape gang life in Los Angeles are highlighted in the story of Homeboy Industries a job creation program initiated by a priest working in LA's most deadly neighborhoods (G-Dog and the Homeboys by Celeste Fremon). Finally in Searching for Whitopia: an improbable journeyninto the heart of White America, Rich Benjamin explores the creation on ethnic enclaves (whitopias) as fear over immigration and the shrinking white majority redefine race consciousnessnin the 21st century. Each of these narratives provides a window into the various ways in which Americans approach the subjects of wealth and the good life, poverty and the underclass, and thenconstruction of class, race, and gender in American society.

This does not mean that humanitarian interventions entail no ethical ot political stakes &iquest; or that they are beyond engaged critique. We need to critique precisely that which we value, and to ask some hard questions, among them these: What are the differences among humanitarianism, charity, and philanthropy? What of social obligations and solidarities? How does the neoliberal world order currently create structural inequalities that ensure the reproduction of poverty and violence? How does the current order of things resemble or differ from the colonial world order?

In this course we will explore a deepening societal intrigue with genetic accounts of personal identity and political meaning.  Students will engage with varied interdisciplinary sources that range from legal cases to scientific articles, medical ethics guidelines, films, and anthropological works (ethnographies).  We will explore several case studies where the use of DNA markers (as proof of heritage, disease risk, or legal standing) has spawned cultural movements that are biosocial in nature.  Throughout we will look at how new social movements are organized around gene-based definitions of personhood, health, and legal truth. Several examples include political analyses of citizenship and belonging.  On this count we will discuss issues of African ancestry testing as evidence in slavery reparations cases, revisit debates on whether Black Freedman should be allowed into the Cherokee and Seminole Nations, and hear arguments on whether people with genetic links to Jewish groups should have a right of return to Israel. We will also examine the ways genetic knowledge may shape different health politics at the individual and societal level. On this count we will do close readings of how personal genomics testing companies operate, we will investigate how health disparities funding as well as orphan disease research take on new valences when re-framed in genetic terms, and we will see how new articulations of global health priorities are emerging through genetic research in places like Africa.  Finally we will explore social implications of forensic uses of DNA.

We review the inherent links between how a question is framed, the types of evidence that can address the question, and way that data are collected. Research activities such as interviewing, participant observation, quantitative observation, archival investigation, ecological survey, linguistic methodology, tracking extended cases, and demographic methods are reviewed. Various faculty and specialists will be brought in to discuss how they use different types of evidence and methods for supporting arguments in anthropology.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["GER:DB-SocSci"],"id":109693,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ebron, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ebron, P."],"location":""}],"id":43339}],[]],"primary_type":"Lab"},
