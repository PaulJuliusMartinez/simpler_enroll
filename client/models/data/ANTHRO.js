Not surprisingly, they have also been central to the study of conservation.  The fascinating adaptations of organisms to the unique ecosystems of the archipelago have left them particularly vulnerable to outside introductions.  Drawing on lessons learned in Galapagos from Darwin's time to the present, this seminar explores evolution, conservation, and their connection in the Galapagos.  Using case-study material on finches, iguanas, tortoises, cacti, Scalesia plants, and more, we will explore current theory and debate about adaptation, sexual selection, speciation, adaptive radiation, and other topics in evolution. Similarly, we will explore the special challenges Gal&aacute;pagos poses today for conservation, owing to both its unusual biota and the increasing human impact on the archipelago.  This course includes an intensive eleven-day expedition to Gal&aacute;pagos to observe firsthand the evolutionary phenomena and conservation issues discussed in class. A chartered ship will serve as our floating classroom, dormitory, and dining hall as we work our way around the archipelago to visit as many as ten islands. For this portion of the class, undergraduates will be joined by a group of Stanford alumni and friends in a format called a Stanford \"Field Seminar.\" Because our class time on campus is limited to one week before travel, students will be required to complete all course readings over the summer. Both on campus and in South America, the course emphasizes student contributions and presentations. Students will be asked to lead discussions and carry out literature research on the evolutionary and conservation biology of particular Gal&aacute;pagos species. The final assignment for the seminar is to complete a seven- to ten-page paper on the evolutionary biology and conservation challenges of a particular organism or adaptation and to present the main findings of that paper in a joint seminar of undergrads and alumni as we travel in Gal&aacute;pagos.  Note: Students will arrive on campus and will be housed at Stanford until we leave for Gal&aacute;pagos. Travel to Gal&aacute;pagos will be provided and paid by Sophomore College (except incidentals) and is made possible by the support of the Stanford Alumni Association Travel/Study Program and generous donors.

It has two specific goals: (1) to introduce the human ecology of Amazonia; and (2) to assess the prospects for joint efforts at biodiversity conservation and community development. We will draw on case studies to investigate such topics as the causes and consequences of deforestation, the social impact of parks and protected areas, and the potential for \"Integrated Conservation and Development Projects\" (ICDPs) such as extractive reserves, natural forest management, biodiversity prospecting, and community-based ecotourism. The course views Amazonia as a microcosm of the challenges facing conservation and development efforts today in the Third World. nPart of the course is an intensive 11-day expedition to the Peruvian Amazon, at no extra cost, to observe firsthand the conservation and development dilemmas discussed in class. We will visit ecolodges in the rainforest, walking miles of trails to learn about local flora, fauna, and conservation efforts. We will also visit Machu Picchu in the upper reaches of the rainforest.  For the travel portion of the class, undergraduates will be joined by a group of Stanford alumni and friends. nStudent contributions and presentations are emphasized throughout the course.  Students are expected to come well-prepared to each session, to lead discussions, and to carry out literature research. The final assignment is a 6 to 8 page paper on a case study of your own choosing&iquest;or an equivalent piece of a longer collaborative paper&iquest;that offers a critical assessment of one particular conservation and/or development project in or near the region we will visit.

His book, with its account of creations and destructions of the world by the gods, the descent of the Hero Twins into the Underworld and their ball games with its lords, and a history of the ruling clan of the Quich&eacute; state, is a grand apology for the values and world of the Quich&eacute; Maya, but it is no drab political treatise.  It relates the daily life of the Quich&eacute; to their natural world (including the skies) and to the underworld journey that they expected in death, and is a compilation crafted to instruct and entertain at several levels of interpretation, from those of sophisticated scholars to children.n\tIn the 1970&iquest;s, we began to realize that many of the ceramic vessels unearthed from the tombs of the Classic Lowland Maya, originally intended to accompany their owners on their perilous journey through the underworld, actually illustrate scenes described in Popol Vuh.  More recently, it has been possible to relate the mythology to texts newly deciphered from Mayan inscriptions as well as vases.  The Popol Vuh has thus been shown to be a survival of a much older and more widespread culture.  Like most survivals, though, it had been re-crafted in the image of the contemporary Quich&eacute; culture.  When are mythological similarities sufficient to imply relatedness of the stories through common descent?  How can mythical similarities imply universals of mind and culture?  How have myths been used as state political instruments?n\tThis is an exciting combination of archaeology, linguistics, cultural anthropology, art, and literature.

We will use a case study approach to ask: (1) What approach to protected area (PA) conservation has been taken in each case? Who are the key proponents and what are their main objectives? (2) How successful has the protected area been at achieving its conservation goals? (3) What are the benefits of the PA to people and who receives them?

(6) Are there alternatives or variations on the theme of protected area conservation that would be more realistic and beneficial? How could the interests of parks and people be made more compatible in each case?

Anthropologists call these rituals. Rituals shape every aspect of our lives, creating our symbolic universes and governing the most minute of our practices. nnFor early anthropologists and for those interested in religious and symbolic life, rituals and rites were seen as both one of the most universal features of human existence, and, as that which enables us to reflect upon our human existence. A prominent example are that of the &iquest;rites de passage&iquest; found in every culture, from puberty initiation rites, weddings or funerals, which socially signal the change from one status to another. While initially for anthropologists, rituals marked the difference between the sacred and the profane, soon scholars began to see the ubiquity of ritual and the symbolic in shaping even the most mundane activity such as the structure of a meal and why one is not meant to eat dessert before the main course. The first half of the class examines these different debates surrounding the meaning and effects of rituals and rites. The second half of the class takes these debates to think about the question of power and politics. We return to the question of how our symbolic universes are staged and imagined by us through ritual forms such as the annual Presidential &iquest;pardoning the turkey&iquest; at Thanksgiving. The question of power however pushes us even further to ask why it is that we obey particular kinds of authority, consent to particular actions, and find ourselves doing things we haven&iquest;t consciously decided to do. Many have argued that these kinds of political questions about how we respond and are shaped by power have something to do with our symbolic worlds and ritual, from the most obvious (the monarchy) to the most subtle (listening in a classroom). Throughout the course, these abstract questions will be grounded in cross-cultural examples and analysis.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ED","WAY-SI"],"id":214938,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":"50-51A"}],"id":18911}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

"186N":{"department":"ANTHRO","number":"186N","title":"The Most Rational People in the World","description":"Humans, broadly construed, emerged as bipedal apes in the African mixed savanna-woodlands approximately two million years ago. From humble beginnings, humans have gone on to be become the ecologically dominant species in most biomes and grown to a global population in excess of seven billion. This dominance arises from a combination of features of the human organism including its extreme degree of behavioral flexibility and flexible social organization. The prima facie evidence of human evolutionary and ecological success raises a paradox with respect to recent work in economics and psychology which increasingly argues for pervasive irrationality in human decision-making in a wide array of behavioral contexts. How is it possible for an organism with such seemingly flawed software supporting decision-making to become the globally dominant species? We will use this contradiction as the launching point for understanding what rationality means in a broad ecological and cross-cultural context. What do we mean by `rationality&iquest;? How do different disciplines conceive of rationality in different ways? Is there such a thing as a rationality that transcends cultural differences or is the very idea of rationality a cultural construction that is used to justify imperialism and other modes of paternalism? Are there systematic factors that promote or impede rational decision-making? The seminar will provide a gentle introduction to the formal approaches of decision theory which we will apply to an unusual array of topics centered on the subsistence and reproductive decisions of hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and agrarian peasants, in short, people living in face-to-face, subsistence societies. In addition to doing reading from a broad array of social and natural science disciplines around the topic of rationality, students will regularly engage in exercises to assess their own approaches to decision-making.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":215600,},

In all three sections we will also examine scientific ethics when subject populations are minorities, or somehow structurally disadvantaged globally.n This capstone course will provide students with tools to explore and critically assess the various technical, social, and ethical positions of researchers, as well as the role of the state and certain publics in shaping scientific research agendas that promise to reorganize critical aspects of human life.  Students will be encouraged to explore these dynamics within such important societal domains as health, law, markets of bio-surveillance, and the growing industry of disease and heritage DNA identity testing among others.  We will read works from social scientists of science practice, ethicists, medial humanists and scientists.  This course will equip students with tools to write about the intersection of science and society and to engage in a research project that relates to the topical foci of the course, broadly conceived.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"id":213206,},

Using a framework of biological and cultural adaptation, we will discuss the major types of current human mobility (e.g. nomadism, immigration, migrant labor, displacement) and how they influence and are influenced by social systems, resource access, and health.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":215381,},

The separation of religion and politics is often written into constitutions as a fundamental priority. Yet around the world, growing numbers of religious movements have sought to dispute the legitimacy of secularism. Social scientists, including anthropologists, are beginning to research the forms of domination and political violence that have been justified in the name of secularism. This course seeks to make sense of this global debate about secularism. It does so by taking up an anthropological perspective: much as anthropologists might study culture, religion, or kinship, we will interrogate secularism as a comparative social artifact, constituted by historically specific repertoires of signs, identities, everyday practices, and institutional powers. The course focuses on case studies in the United States, Western Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ED","WAY-SI"],"id":213423,},

How do we understand phenomena such as gang cultures, addiction and the realignment of white consciousness? This class uses the methods and modes of ethnographic study in an examination of American culture. Ethnographic materials range from an examination of the new American wealth boom of the last 20 years (Richistan by Robert Frank) to the extreme and deadlynworld of the invisible underclass of homeless addicts on the streets of San Francisco (Righteous Dopefiend by Phillipe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg). The experiences of Hispanic immigrants and the struggle to escape gang life in Los Angeles are highlighted in the story of Homeboy Industries a job creation program initiated by a priest working in LA's most deadly neighborhoods (G-Dog and the Homeboys by Celeste Fremon). Finally in Searching for Whitopia: an improbable journeyninto the heart of White America, Rich Benjamin explores the creation on ethnic enclaves (whitopias) as fear over immigration and the shrinking white majority redefine race consciousnessnin the 21st century. Each of these narratives provides a window into the various ways in which Americans approach the subjects of wealth and the good life, poverty and the underclass, and thenconstruction of class, race, and gender in American society.

This does not mean that humanitarian interventions entail no ethical ot political stakes &iquest; or that they are beyond engaged critique. We need to critique precisely that which we value, and to ask some hard questions, among them these: What are the differences among humanitarianism, charity, and philanthropy? What of social obligations and solidarities? How does the neoliberal world order currently create structural inequalities that ensure the reproduction of poverty and violence? How does the current order of things resemble or differ from the colonial world order? This course examines the history of humanitarian sensibilities and the emergence of organized action in the &iquest;cause of humanity&iquest;.  In the early years of humanitarian intervention, political neutrality was a key principle; it has now come under ever greater analytical and political scrutiny. We will examine the reasons for the politicization and militarization of aid -- be it humanitarian aid in natural disasters or political crises; development programs in the impoverished south (&iquest;the Third World&iquest;), or peace-keeping. We will end with a critical exploration of the concept of human rights, humanity, and personhood. The overall methodological aim of the course is to demonstrate what insights an ethnographic approach to the politics, ethics, and aesthetics of humanitarianism can offer.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":211299,},

Power in this reckoning could force, whereas authority had to always be in some ways legitimated. Foucault&iquest;s critique of such an account of power is well known and Foucauldian notions of power as dispersed, capillary, and as discursive has permeated anthropological discussions. Power has become the central and catch all term for all forms of asymmetrical social and state-subject relations. The contemporary turn to theories of sovereignty is an example of dissatisfaction with our current usages of power as dispersed and thus all encompassing. Authority, the former staple of classical anthropology has been left hanging theoretically, though notions of legitimate authority, popular, gendered, religious, national, continue to underpin the possibility of our analysis. While for Weber power was often located in persons and authority as a function of systems, in anthropology has often located power as that which emanates from institutionalized forms and authority as personally fashioned around culturally specific notions of credibility, sacrality, and legitimacy. In this course, we will discuss critical approaches to authority and power and try to generate some critical questions for how an anthropology of the political that explicitly (rather than implicitly) re-addresses authority might look.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":215970,},

"384":{"department":"ANTHRO","number":"384","title":"Sacrifice, Ethics and Modern Convictions","description":"This course is an investigation of how notions of sacrifice, of ethics and conviction are embedded in both ordinary and extraordinary practices in our contemporary world. The key question is how the modern global condition has transformed the way in which it is possible to hold convictions, and to frame forms of ethical conduct, be they religious or secular. We will ask if convictions based on choice or moral outrage differ from convictions based on inhabiting and reversing stigmatized racial and social identities. Rather than maintaining a categorical distinction between `the religious&iquest; and `the secular&iquest;, we will focus on how groups and individuals have attached themselves passionately to ideas, abstractions, ritual communities or ethical frames. When do certain attachments appear necessary and compelling, almost beyond choice? How does one forge a sense of ethics and ethical conduct through social media rather than face-to-face contact?n nStudents will acquire a grounded and guided understanding of philosophical and anthropological theories of ideas of ethics, sacrifice, and political conviction as well as explore these ideas through contemporary ethnographic contexts.nReadings will be philosophical, historical and ethnographic &iquest; drawing on original texts and ethnographic accounts from Europe, Asia and Africa.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":215104,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"460-429"}],"id":29047}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

"387":{"department":"ANTHRO","number":"387","title":"Strangers and Intimate: Exploring Civility","description":"How do we encounter and read each other in public and private spaces? How are these very spaces historically constituted around such distinctions and manners of reading? What do these questions look like in dense heterogeneous cities with differentiated class, caste and ethnic communities? How might we consider the differentiation between private and public in different ethnographic contexts? What kinds of sociality might emerge from these kinds of encounters? This course will explore these questions through social theory and ethnographies. There are two major sets of concepts that will be explored and interrogated. The first is that deriving from the essays of the Georg Simmel such as &iquest;The Face&iquest; and &iquest;The Stranger&iquest; which explore the new forms of sociality enabled by seemingly anonymous city life, which in turn have been interpreted very differently by Zygmunt Bauman and James Siegel to understand the place of continually excluded outsiders and the high stakes of reading each other. The other is the strand of work on the emergence of the public sphere such as the work of Jurgen Habermas, Richard Sennet, Michael Warner, Nancy Fraser etc. While much of the social theory on the public, the stranger and civility emerge from studies of Euro-American mas politics and city spaces, in this course we will move some of these discussion into considering these questions in the global south and the kinds of sociality (including their historicity) that make up the dense fabric of ordinary life. How does this work out in contexts where we take into account intense social differentiation by class, race, and communitarian divisions? This could be asked of the historical and social context addressed in these theories as well as from the postcolonial world. The course will attempt to understand whether such theorizations can indeed be re-rooted and re-imagined or whether ethnographic and historical difference re-route them instead. In doing so we will also bring theories of the private and the intimate to bear on questions of the public and the stranger.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":215233,},
"388":{"department":"ANTHRO","number":"388","title":"Anthropology of the Extraordinary: Ontologies and Phenomenologies","description":"In the last few years anthropology has taken what has come to be called an &iquest;ontological turn&iquest; in which the ways an object or experience is felt to be real is explored from different perspectives.  Often this involves exploring phenomena (like ghosts, talking trees and humans who become jaguars) which could be called &iquest;extraordinary&iquest; and which challenge secular, western expectations of what is real.  There has also been a &iquest;phenomenological turn&iquest; in which anthropologists have become interested in classifying and categorizing human experience in particular detail. The class will explore the scholarship in this area. Readings will include an introduction to classic philosophical writing (William James, Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger) and more recent work such as David Hufford, The Terror that Comes in the Night; Eduardo Kohn How Forests Think; Morton Pederson Not Quite Shamans; Ann Taves Religious Experience Reconsidered;  Annemarie Mol, The Body Multiple; Roger Lohmann Dream Travelers, and others.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":215846,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":29869}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
