Students will study Stanford in terms of the built environment (e.g. architecture; how buildings and styles interact; how the landscape shapes the flow of people, plants, and animals), the human interactions (e.g. sociology of tourism, the politics of land use), and the ecology (flora, fauna, geology, climatology, and pest control) of campus.nThe students in this course will defamiliarize themselves with their campus environment and approach Stanford with new eyes-the eyes of the anthropologist, the photographer, the historian, the artist, and the tourist. We will explore its edifices, gardens, sculptures, open spaces, and commercial areas. Moreover, we will use Stanford as a lens to discuss a variety of disciplines: architecture, educational theory, California history, climatology, and natural history.  But more than anything, we will focus on the human component, including the vision, drive, and serendipity that shaped the University.nIn taking the course students will hone their skills in field observation that will carry over to future field work in more distant locales, develop an interdisciplinary approach to analyzing complex institutions, and gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and richness of Stanford that will enhance all aspects of their remaining time as undergraduates. On a daily basis, the class will consist of three components: class presentations and discussions, formal and informal talks by many of the local experts at Stanford, and topical field trips. Students will select a theme that is of personal interest and develop field observation techniques useful for their particular topics. Course assignments will be to give two presentations on specific aspects of Stanford. In addition, each student will keep a field note-book with daily observations and field notes, post a collection of photographic observations, and complete pertinent readings.

Not surprisingly, they have also been central to the study of conservation.  The fascinating adaptations of organisms to the unique ecosystems of the archipelago have left them particularly vulnerable to outside introductions.  Drawing on lessons learned in Galapagos from Darwin's time to the present, this seminar explores evolution, conservation, and their connection in the Galapagos.  Using case-study material on finches, iguanas, tortoises, cacti, Scalesia plants, and more, we will explore current theory and debate about adaptation, sexual selection, speciation, adaptive radiation, and other topics in evolution. Similarly, we will explore the special challenges Gal&aacute;pagos poses today for conservation, owing to both its unusual biota and the increasing human impact on the archipelago.  This course includes an intensive eleven-day expedition to Gal&aacute;pagos to observe firsthand the evolutionary phenomena and conservation issues discussed in class. A chartered ship will serve as our floating classroom, dormitory, and dining hall as we work our way around the archipelago to visit as many as ten islands. For this portion of the class, undergraduates will be joined by a group of Stanford alumni and friends in a format called a Stanford \"Field Seminar.\" Because our class time on campus is limited to one week before travel, students will be required to complete all course readings over the summer. Both on campus and in South America, the course emphasizes student contributions and presentations. Students will be asked to lead discussions and carry out literature research on the evolutionary and conservation biology of particular Gal&aacute;pagos species. The final assignment for the seminar is to complete a seven- to ten-page paper on the evolutionary biology and conservation challenges of a particular organism or adaptation and to present the main findings of that paper in a joint seminar of undergrads and alumni as we travel in Gal&aacute;pagos.

The course is designed to explore the pros and cons of parks and protected areas as they impact flora, fauna, and human inhabitants, and to address the dilemma of how to achieve conservation in a manner that creates local community benefits and is socially just. We will use a case study approach to ask: (1) What approach to protected area (PA) conservation has been taken in each case? Who are the key proponents and what are their main objectives? (2) How successful has the protected area been at achieving its conservation goals? (3) What are the benefits of the PA to people and who receives them? (4) What are the costs of the PA to people and who pays them? (5) Where benefits are not commensurate to costs, what, if anything, is being done to address the imbalance? How well is it working? (6) Are there alternatives or variations on the theme of protected area conservation that would be more realistic and beneficial? How could the interests of parks and people be made more compatible in each case? Is there any chance for an \"integrated conservation-development project\" (ICDP), or is that just \"wishful thinking,\" as some critics insist?nnThis course includes an intensive 12-day expedition to Tanzania to observe firsthand the dilemmas of parks and peoples we have discussed in class.
