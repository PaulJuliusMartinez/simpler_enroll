This course raises a series of ethical questions, following along the path of a person's life - questions that arise before, during, and after she lives it.  We will explore distinctive questions that a life presents at each of several familiar stages: prior to birth, childhood, adulthood, death, and even beyond.  We will consider how some philosophers have tried to answer these questions, and we will think about how answering them might help us form a better understanding of the ethical shape of a human life as a whole.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-ER", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":216130,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lee, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":["Lee, R.","Fischer, I.","Dannenberg, J."],"location":"School of Education 206"}],"id":15843}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
