"44Y":{"department":"BIO","number":"44Y","title":"Core Plant Biology & Eco Evo Laboratory","description":"The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of how to conduct biological research, using a topic in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Plant Biology as a practical example. This includes the complete scientific process: assessing background literature, generating testable hypotheses, learning techniques for field- and lab-based data collection, analyzing data using appropriate statistical methods, and finally writing and sharing results. To build these skills, this course will focus on the ecology of oak regeneration at Stanford's nearby Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. Students, working in teams, will develop novel research hypotheses and execute the necessary experiments and measurements to test these hypotheses. The capstone of the course will be an oral defense of students' findings, as well as a research paper in the style of a peer-reviewed journal article. Labs will be completed both on campus and at Jasper Ridge. Lab fee. Information about this class is available at http://bio44.stanford.edu. Satisfies WIM in Biology.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-SMA"],"id":111851,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":30986}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Burford, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Burford, B.","Perea, R.","Dirzo, R."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":46879}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Perea, R.","Malladi, S."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":43531},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Malladi, S.","Perea, R.","Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":43529},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Malladi, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Malladi, S.","Perea, R."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":43533},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Perea, R.","Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Malladi, S."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":43530},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:20:00 PM","instructors":["Malladi, S.","Perea, R.","Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":43532},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Perea, R.","Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Malladi, S."],"location":"Gilbert Biological Science 119"}],"id":36151}]],"primary_type":"Lab","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Dirzo, R.","Perea, R."],"location":""}],"id":31032}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Dirzo, R.","Perea, R."],"location":""}],"id":46903}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Malladi, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Malladi, S.","Perea, R."],"location":""}],"id":43536},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Perea, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Malladi, S.","Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Perea, R."],"location":""}],"id":43538},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Malladi, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Malladi, S.","Perea, R.","Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"location":""}],"id":43539},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Malladi, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Hekmat-Scafe, D.","Perea, R.","Malladi, S."],"location":""}],"id":43537},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"1:30:00 PM","instructors":["Malladi, S.","Perea, R.","Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"location":""}],"id":43535},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Malladi, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Perea, R.","Malladi, S.","Hekmat-Scafe, D."],"location":""}],"id":43534}]],"secondary_type":"Lab Section"},
