Students learn to write computational algorithms for sequence alignment, motif finding, expression array analysis, structural modeling, structure design and prediction, and network analysis and modeling. Students become familiar with the technologies used in CSI, which include dynamic programming, Markov and hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, clustering methods, and energy minimization approaches. Designed for students with strong foundations in either immunology or computer science .
