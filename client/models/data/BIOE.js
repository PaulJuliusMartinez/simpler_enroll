The second quarter focuses on how to take a conceptual solution to an important medical need forward from early concept to technology translation, development and possible commercialization. Students expand on the topics they learned in OIT384 to learn about prototyping; patent strategies; advanced planning for reimbursement and FDA approval; choosing translation and commercialization route (licensing vs. start-up); marketing, sales and distribution strategies; ethical issues including conflict of interest; fundraising approaches and cash requirements; financial modeling; essentials of writing a business or research plan; strategies for assembling a development team. Students continue to work in multidisciplinary teams to select a final concept and develop a business plan. Final presentations are made to a panel of prominent venture investors and serve the role of a VC pitch.  New students (i.e. students who did not take OIT384 in the winter quarter) will need to submit an application at http://www.stanford.edu/group/biodesign/courseapplication11.html. Students who took OIT384 in the winter quarter are automatically accepted into the spring quarter.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"18:05:00"},{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"18:05:00"}]}]]},
