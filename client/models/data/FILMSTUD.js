Not only does horror have deep and diverse roots in the international history of film; it emerges as a trope of film itself, as a medium of shadows, dematerialized presence, life drained of substance. This course offers an overview of filmic imaginations of horror across the span of the twentieth century, with a focus on the US, Europe, and Japan. We will read and discuss theories of horror - from the fantastic to the uncanny - and unpack these in light of key moments in the genre's development. We will debate the merits of vampires versus zombies. And we will trace, through the lens of horror, ongoing debates about cinematic representation, from Andre Bazin's idea of the \"mummy complex\" to Linda Williams' thesis of \"body genres\" to Jeffrey Sconce's notion of \"haunted media.\" The course will serve as an introduction to film analysis and interpretation; no prior experience in film studies is required or expected.

Her career straddled multiple media: film, recording, live performance and television. From childhood, her life was lived in the public eye, and her personal travails were as well known as the characters she incarnated on screen. In fact, her biography informs some of her later film roles. Garland's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the musical and the melodrama, and some of her best films were directed by two of the foremost studio directors - Vincente Minnelli and George Cukor. The intersections between star, genre, and director will inform the work of the seminar. Both a mainstream star and a gay cult icon, Garland's persona was read differently by different audiences, so the seminar will also consider the reception of Garland and her significance to audiences then and now.  nnnMost courses on film are built around directors, genres, nations, or periods. A course on the films of Judy Garland proposes that the body of films in which Garland starred over nearly three decades demonstrate not only a coherence and consistency, but also a variety, that merits closer examination. Stars frequently exerted control over their materials, but this an aspect of filmmaking that has received little attention in the classroom.nnnOpen to graduate students and advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor; capstone course for majors (senior seminar).
