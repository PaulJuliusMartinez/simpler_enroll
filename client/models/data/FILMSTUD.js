Overview of filmic imaginations of horror with a focus on the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Theories of horror, from the fantastic to the uncanny; unpacking these in light of key moments in the genre's development. The merits of vampires versus zombies. Ongoing debates through the lens of horror about cinematic representation, from Andre Bazin's idea of the mummy complex to Linda Williams' thesis of body genres to Jeffrey Sconce's notion of haunted media.

From childhood, her life was lived in the public eye, and her personal travails were as well known as the characters she incarnated on screen. In fact, her biography informs some of her later film roles. Garland's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the musical and the melodrama, and some of her best films were directed by Vincente Minnelli and George Cukor. The intersections between star, genre, and director. Both a mainstream star and a gay cult icon, Garland's persona was read differently by different audiences; the reception of Garland and her significance to audiences then and now.
