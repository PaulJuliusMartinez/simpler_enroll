An eye which is molded by gender, race, culture and class - all of which influence the entire film-making process and experience from how something is framed to how it is cut and and how it is perceived it. How we look at something, for how long we look at it and in what context we are shown something is as important as what we are looking at. Similarly the subjective eye of the viewer shapes how he or she understands and interprets the film. Whether the viewer is an insider or outsider to the subject completely changes expectations and reactions to the film. So then what are we really talking about when we talk about documentary films? What makes a documentary a documentary? Why is such a categorization valuable? necessary? useful? nThe course will combine analysis of films, theoretical texts, and some practical &iquest;production\" exercises.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217187,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 007"},{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"7:30:00 PM","end":"9:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 115"}],"id":46208}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
