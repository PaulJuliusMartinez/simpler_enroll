"355":{"department":"FILMSTUD","number":"355","title":"Comics and the City","description":"Urban history and life informs the history, stories, structures and aesthetics of the comics, coinciding with the emergence of the modern metropolis in America and Europe and is rooted in the same industrial, commercial, and social transformations. Comics and cartoons were fixtures of urbane humor publications of the 19th century and became a valued fixture of the American newspaper in the very earliest part of the 20th. The characters in early comic strips were often denizens of the urban world, whether immigrants fresh off the boat or the nouveau riche. Many strips were grounded in quotidian urban experience. Later comics use the city as setting, aesthetic, and metaphor. The mean streets of Jacques Tardi's noirish cities abut the rather sunnier and shinier example of Superman's Metropolis. Science fiction comics and manga give us the impacted and often destructed cities of the future. The graphic novel adaptation of Paul Auster's City of Glass maps the grid pattern of the comics page onto the gridded streets of Manhattan. Chris Ware's Building Stories series uses one apartment building to follow the myriad and sometimes intersecting lines found therein. Assigned readings include many comics alongside urban and comics scholarship. Artists to be considered include Outcault, Swinnerton, McCay, Eisner, Katchor, Tatsumi, Doucet, Tardi, Otomo. Herg&eacute;, Mazzuchelli, Chaykin, Miller, Ware, Pekar, Crumb, Gloeckner.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":213520,},

Key examples and the recent legacy of film noir: 40s and 50s Hollywood movies featuring anti-heroes, femmes fatales, shattered dreams, violence, and a heaviness of mood. Film noir's influences included pulp fiction; B-movie production-budgets; changes in Hollywood genres; left-populist aesthetic movements; a visual style imported by European &eacute;migr&eacute; directors; innovations in camera and film technology; changes in gender roles; combat fatigue; and anxieties about the economy, communism and crime.

The course examines technologies from the Renaissance through the present day, from telescopes and microscopes to digital detectors, that have changed and enhanced our visual capabilities as well as shaped how we imagine the world. We also consider how these technologies influenced and inspired the work of artists. Special attention is paid to how different technologies such as linear perspective, photography, cinema, and computer screens translate the visual experience into a representation; the automation of vision; and the intersection of technology with conceptions of time and space.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":213161,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:35:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"Annaud"}],"id":30425}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

They even rely on common tools to make discoveries and visually represent their conclusions.
