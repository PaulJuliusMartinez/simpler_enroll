In this course, we will explore the diverse traditions of both epics from their Sanskrit versions, first composed more than 2,000 years ago, through retellings in newer media forms well into the twenty-first century. Among our primary interests will be comparing versions of each epic that have circulated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the West at different times. We begin with abridged translations of both the Sanskrit Mahabharata (including the Bhagavadgita) and the Ramayana. We will discuss the major literary, religious, and social themes of each text as well as subsequent translations and transcreations of the stories in Indian and Southeast Asian contexts during the last thousand years. We will also investigate the modern lives of the epics, including their transformations into Indian television serials, film versions of both narratives (from India and America), and invocations of the epic stories in contemporary art, culture, and political disputes. Students will gain exposure to some of the foundational texts for the study of South Asia, both past and present. More broadly, students will cultivate the ability to fruitfully approach texts from different cultures and learn to critically analyze the impacts and roles of stories in various religious, literary, and historical contexts.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum", "WAY-ED"],"id":214738,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Truschke, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Truschke, A."],"location":""}],"id":30391}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
