Despite all this, Iranian cinema in exile is in no sense any less important than Iranian cinema inside Iran.nIn this course we will view one such film, made outside Iran, in each class meeting and expect to reach a common consensus in identifying the general patterns within these works and this movement. Questions such as the ones listed below will be addressed in our meetings each week:nWhat changes in aesthetics and point of view of the filmmaker are caused by the change in his or her work environment?nThough unwantedly these films are made outside Iran, how related are they to the known (recognized) cinema within Iran?nAnd in fact, to what extent do these films express things that are left unsaid by the cinema within Iran?","min_units":1,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212740,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"6:05:00 PM","location":"260-113"}],"id":18552}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Forty-six years ago when \"Theater in Iran\" (a monograph on the history of Iranian plays) by Bahram Beyzaie was first published, it put the then contemporary Iranian theater movement--which was altogether westernizing itself blindly - face to face with a new kind of self-awareness. Hence in today's generation of playwrights and stage directors in Iran, all know something of their theatrical heritage. In this course we will spend some class sessions on the history of theater in Iran and some class meetings will be concentrating on contemporary movements and present day playwrights.
