They were originally started by individual spontaneous attempts from different corners of the world and by now we can identify common lines of interest amongst them. There are also major differences between them.  These films have never been allowed to be screened inside Iran, and without any support from the global system of production and distribution, as independent and individual attempts, they have enjoyed little attention. Despite all this, Iranian cinema in exile is in no sense any less important than Iranian cinema inside Iran.  In this course we will view one such film, made outside Iran, in each class meeting and expect to reach a common consensus in identifying the general patterns within these works and this movement. Questions such as the ones listed below will be addressed in our meetings each week:  What changes in aesthetics and point of view of the filmmaker are caused by the change in his or her work environment?  Though unwantedly these films are made outside Iran, how related are they to the known (recognized) cinema within Iran?

It is a collaborative course. We will work in tandem with Professor Cathy Davidson¿s course at Duke, ¿The History and Future of High Education,¿ using live chats, Google documents, and other forums to interact with students at Duke (and at the University of Maryland and other colleges and universities nationally). Each campus will use a slightly different syllabus, linked to each instructor¿s particular angle into this general subject, but we will also have many readings and exercises in common. We see this as a critical moment in education, and connect this topic to its historical, cultural, political, and ethical implications.  Our Stanford course looks at early discussions about education and culture (Arnold¿s Culture and Anarchy) and then works through a key moment in the mid-twentieth century whose premises still have influence - the famous Two Cultures (humanities, sciences) debate. We next delve into the radical responses to educational reform in France and the US in the late 1960s, and finally consider the changing state of funding, value, and cultural critique in the late twentieth and early-twenty-first century. In particular we examine the idea of education as a personal, collective, and intensely intellectual endeavor which is shaped by and shapes societies.
