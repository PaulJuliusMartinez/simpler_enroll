Medical diagnostics will be divided into bio-chips (in-vitro diagnostics) and medical and molecular imaging (in-vivo imaging). In-depth discussion on cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the role of diagnostics and nano-therapies.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":210886,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Wu, I."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Smith, G.","Wang, S.","Wu, I.","de la Zerda, A.","Gani, A.","Altae-Tran, H."],"location":"Gates B1"}],"id":24182}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Topics include: forces that stabilize macromolecular structure and their complexes; thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of macromolecular folding, binding, and allostery; diffusional processes; kinetics of enzymatic processes; the relationship of these principles to practical application in experimental design and interpretation. The class emphasizes interactive learning, and is divided equally among lectures, in-class group problem solving, and discussion of current and classical literature.  Enrollment limited to 50. Prerequisites: Background in biochemistry and physical chemistry recommended but material available for those with deficiency in these areas; undergraduates with consent of instructor only.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":127288,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Harbury, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,true],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Fordyce, P.","Yeh, E.","Harbury, P.","Herschlag, D."],"location":"Alway Building, Room M114"}],"id":24645}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
