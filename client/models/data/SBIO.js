{"225":{"department":"SBIO","number":"225","title":"Bio-chips, Imaging and Nanomedicine (EE 225, MATSCI 382)","description":"The course covers state-of-the-art and emerging bio-sensors, bio-chips, imaging modalities, and nano-therapies which will be studied in the context of human physiology including the nervous system, circulatory system and immune system. Medical diagnostics will be divided into bio-chips (in-vitro diagnostics) and medical and molecular imaging (in-vivo imaging). In-depth discussion on cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the role of diagnostics and nano-therapies.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":210886,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:50:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"Herrin T175"}],"id":28592}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"241":{"department":"SBIO","number":"241","title":"Biological Macromolecules (BIOC 241, BIOPHYS 241)","description":"The physical and chemical basis of macromolecular function. Topics include: forces that stabilize macromolecular structure and their complexes; thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of macromolecular folding, binding, and allostery; diffusional processes; kinetics of enzymatic processes; the relationship of these principles to practical application in experimental design and interpretation. The class emphasizes interactive learning, and is divided equally among lectures, in-class group problem solving, and discussion of current and classical literature.  Enrollment limited to 50. Prerequisites: Background in biochemistry and physical chemistry recommended but material available for those with deficiency in these areas; undergraduates with consent of instructor only.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":127288,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,true],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"Alway Building, Room M114"}],"id":28981}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
