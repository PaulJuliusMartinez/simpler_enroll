"81Q":{"department":"OBGYN","number":"81Q","title":"Perspectives on the Abortion Experience in Western Fiction","description":"Explores the role of media in delivering abortion-related messages as well as the broader questions of how abortion and related issues are fundamentally integrated into the social fabric of US and global societies. Abortion remains one of the most controversial and polarizing challenges of our time. Yet, it has been a clinical, social, political, and cultural fact in a broad swath of societies for centuries. As is common for such lightning rod issues, the topic of abortion has featured prominently in novels and films. Each treatment provides a unique perspective on at least one aspect of abortion, whether it be clinical, social, political or cultural. How abortion is portrayed in novels and films provides the student of history, anthropology, and biology with insights into the author's or director's perspectives, and into societal attitudes and mores.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212883,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Blumenthal, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Blumenthal, P."],"location":""}],"id":25607}]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
