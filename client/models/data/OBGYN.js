Yet, it has been a clinical, social, political, and cultural fact in a broad swath of societies for centuries. As is common for such lightning rod issues, the topic of abortion has featured prominently in a number of novels and films. Each treatment provides a unique perspective on at least one aspect of abortion, whether it be clinical, social, political or cultural. Examination of how abortion is portrayed in novels and films provides the student of history, anthropology, and biology not only with insights into the author's or director's perspectives, but also into societal attitudes and mores.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212883,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"5:00:00 PM","end":"8:30:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30249}]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
