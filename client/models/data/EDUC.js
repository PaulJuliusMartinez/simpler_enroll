From coffee shops to shopping malls, it plays a crucial role in creating both common experiences and individual conceptions of self. Yet, music also has this powerful ability to seemingly transcend particular people, moments, or places. What is it about music that can so strongly anchor us to our own experiences, and paradoxically shake us loose from our mornings and wake us from our everyday lives? Lots of people have stories about music that evidences both of these tendencies. But nowhere else are these two, seemingly opposing qualities on display than in the music of religious communities. Whether we are talking about Gregorian chant, contemporary Christian worship music, Jewish cantillation of Sufi qawwali, music and musical style play a central role in the experience of ritual and in shaping how people understand themselves in relation to it. But what is it about music that fuels that experience? Does music have to be \"religious\" to do that kind of cultural work? Can you have a \"religious\" experience in a \"secular\" setting? The answer might depend on your relationship to the music you are hearing or playing. In this seminar, we are going to explore these questions by attending first and foremost to the sounds of religious life. We are going to begin by listening, and expand our understandings through readings and ethnographic fieldwork. Each of these modes of exploration will provide us with greater insight into the role that music plays in shaping religious experience and, in turn, how people understand themselves in relationship to both religion and music.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213430,},

This course explores instances like those that highlight the interaction between language and identity and its implications for learning. The theme of language and identity emerges as significant because of the subtle yet powerful impact it has on our cultural interactions. We have an inherent expectation of how we expect people to communicate. Yet, do these expectations interfere with teaching and learning practices? Many individuals take seminars and classes that focus on teaching professional modes of communication and discourse. This course will offer a detailed examination of scholarship that investigates the power of the subtle messages embedded in language. In addition, to gain a sense of the power of these interactions in practice, we will engage in the following research activities: (a) Participants will engage in school site visits to examine these interactions in practice; (b) Participants will engage in critical interviews of broadcasters at a local television station to discuss the role of language and identity in their presentation; and (c) We will visit a recording studio to discuss the role of language and identity with local hip-hop producers and artists.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":213016,},

In small groups, students will co-design projects that both draw on ideas generated from their readings and discussions and involve local high school students and educators.nThrough various lenses, we will survey the landscape of urban education in the United States and explore myriad theories or explanations for existing conditions, crises, and policies.

It is widely recognized that the goals of legislation often are not realized and that the failure frequently rests in breakdowns in the implementation process by the agencies and organizations charged with implementing the legislation. In response to problems in implementation, the institutional context of public policy implementation is changing. One category of innovations, known by names such as \"management-based regulation\" and \"evidence-based\" social service delivery, gives broad discretion to street-level service providers but subjects them to intensive monitoring and disciplined performance comparison. Another category applies market concepts to regulation or social services, for example, by creating tradable rights (e.g. pollution allowances) or vouchers (for schools, housing, or healthcare). These, and other, new approaches are affecting both the contours of public law doctrine and the nature of lawyering in the public sector. Lawyers in the public sector are increasingly drawing on skills of institutional design and monitoring of the kind associated with private sector transactional practice. nnThis seminar will examine some of the emerging general themes of innovative policy implementation and look at a range of case studies. Topics will include the conditions under which financial and other rewards and sanctions are useful in bringing about desired behaviors, the pluses and minuses of the creation of markets as alternatives to government run programs, and efforts at improving implementation by improving management activities. Examples will be taken from both regulation and social services, and are likely to include environmental protection, education, child protective services, healthcare, food and workplace safety, nuclear power safety, and regulation of financial institutions. nnWe will invite presentations by academics and practitioners.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212623,},
