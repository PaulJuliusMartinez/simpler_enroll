The word \"success\" comes from Latin successus, meaning \"an advance or good result,\" and the verb succedere, \"to come after\" (chronologically). Now people use the word to refer to (a) the accomplishment of an aim, (b) the attainment of popularity or profit, or (c) a person or thing that achieves desired aims or attains prosperity.  In this seminar, we will trace the meaning of the word \"success\" through history, politics, and culture - straight into your lives as Stanford students.  What are mainstream notions of \"success\" and \"failure\" in the educational system today?  Who or what creates these categories and assigns people to them?  What are the consequences of these categories for our everyday lives?  What do \"success\" and \"failure\" mean to you, your culture and your communities?  Through discussion, reading, creative writing and reflection, we will interrogate \"success\" and \"failure\" from a variety of angles.  You will develop a deeper understanding of the various ways that these words are used, and you will be asked to develop your own personal, cultural and communal definitions.","min_units":1,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":211442,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["O'Keeffe, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["O'Keeffe, J."],"location":""}],"id":28510}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
