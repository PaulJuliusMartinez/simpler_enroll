In a commencement address at Kenyon College, David Foster Wallace shares the following story: \"There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, 'Morning, boys. How's the water?' And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, 'What the hell is water?'\"  Wallace goes on to say that \"the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.\"  In this class, we will explore the water that we are swimming in everyday: the culture at Stanford and our personal values.  The two may be in resonance or in tension.  Through a variety of readings and ethnographic activities, such as making observations and collecting cultural artifacts, we will become ethnographers of our own institution.  We will supplement this inquiry with a personal archeology: digging out our own personal set of values and examining how they connect or conflict with \"mainstream\" culture at Stanford.  This will involve a suite of practices that may prove useful in your everyday life: mindfulness practices, self-reflection prompts, and partner exercises all designed to help you access and articulate your personal values.

These new curriculum policies mandate that the study of Afro-Brazilian, African, and Indigenous histories and cultures must be taught at all educational levels including at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. As part of this mandate, educators are now directed to incorporate considerations of ethnic-racial diversity in relation to people's thinking and experiences. These policies aim to fight racism as well as other forms of discrimination, and moreover, encourage the building of more equitable pedagogies. This course will discuss past and current policies and practices in Brazilian education from the point of view of different social projects organized by Indigenous Peoples, Afro-Brazilians, Asian-Brazilians, as well as Euro-Brazilians. It will also focus on Latin American efforts to promote equity in education, as well as to articulate different points of view, and reinforce and build epistemologies that support the decolonization of thinking, behaviors, research and policies. As part of this process, the course will study the experiences of people demanding these new public policies in terms of the extent to which they were able to influence institutional structures and to establish particular policy reforms. The course will also analyze theoretical frameworks employed by opponents of these movements to resist policies that might challenge their privileged place in society. In doing this, the course will offer theoretical and methodological avenues to promote research that can counter hegemonic curricular policies and pedagogical practices. The course will be fully participatory and oriented towards generating ongoing conversations and discussion about the various issues that arose in Brazil in relation to these two recent laws. To meet these goals, we will do a close reading of relevant scholarly works, paying particular attention to their theoretical frameworks, research designs, and findings.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":216081,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Goncalves e Silva, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","instructors":["Goncalves e Silva, P."],"location":""}],"id":33092}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

These new curriculum policies mandate that the study of Afro-Brazilian, African, and Indigenous histories and cultures must be taught at all educational levels including at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. As part of this mandate, educators are now directed to incorporate considerations of ethnic-racial diversity in relation to people's thinking and experiences. These policies aim to fight racism as well as other forms of discrimination, and moreover, encourage the building of more equitable pedagogies. This course will discuss past and current policies and practices in Brazilian education from the point of view of different social projects organized by Indigenous Peoples, Afro-Brazilians, Asian-Brazilians, as well as Euro-Brazilians. It will also focus on Latin American efforts to promote equity in education, as well as to articulate different points of view, and reinforce and build epistemologies that support the decolonization of thinking, behaviors, research and policies. As part of this process, the course will study the experiences of people demanding these new public policies in terms of the extent to which they were able to influence institutional structures and to establish particular policy reforms. The course will also analyze theoretical frameworks employed by opponents of these movements to resist policies that might challenge their privileged place in society. In doing this, the course will offer theoretical and methodological avenues to promote research that can counter hegemonic curricular policies and pedagogical practices. The course will be fully participatory and oriented towards generating ongoing conversations and discussion about the various issues that arose in Brazil in relation to these two recent laws. To meet these goals, we will do a close reading of relevant scholarly works, paying particular attention to their theoretical frameworks, research designs, and findings.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":216081,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Goncalves e Silva, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","instructors":["Goncalves e Silva, P."],"location":""}],"id":33064}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
