What sets them apart? Approaching theater as presentational form of organization, this class shifts study of theater from the context of literature to that of performance. It offers an overview of performance across disciplines: from theater and other performing arts, to law, management, sports, and new technologies. In this interdisciplinary exploration, performance emerges as a model that cuts across diverse branches of contemporary culture, from sports events, to social dances, to political protests, to the organization of a workplace. It is designed to serve students who may go on to major or minor in Theater and Performance Studies including the Dance division and also students for whom this knowledge is a general contribution to their liberal arts education or to their own field of study. It integrates scholarly research and practical use of performance. No previous performing arts training or skills are required.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AII"],"id":213846,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:50:00","location":"Memaud125"}],"id":56538}],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:50:00","location":"Memaud125"}],"id":57616}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

The aforementioned works are generally bound to what has been a successful Broadway musical formula, which emerged in the mid to early 20th century with musicals like Oklahoma! Historically, we save the word opera for such art that exceeds the ¿sophistication¿ of what we think of as musical theater. However, musical theater is a vastly untapped resource of potential artistic innovation and has unfortunately become stuck in an ideal of universal accessibility. In this course, students should begin to create pieces that are fresh and innovative forms of musical theater that do not necessarily appeal to specifically popular audiences but perhaps to audiences more associated with high art, opera, or even contemporary independent music (indie rock et al.). If the pieces that are created do appeal to a mass audience, they should do so in a way that has not been done before.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214803,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:50:00","location":"Memaud204"}],"id":56810}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},

What can actors learn about themselves and their ensemble through physical improvisation and composition? How does movement training clarify and deepen the actor¿s performance? This course explores the fundamentals of stage combat and contact improvisation as a means of strengthening mind-body connection and preparing the actor for more nuanced, responsive, emotionally-rooted physical work on the stage.n nOur training consists of four main components: physical conditioning, practical techniques, improvisation and movement composition. Each class incorporates a detailed movement sequence designed to function both as a warm-up practice and a long-term physical training tool for the performer. In the technique portion of our course, we will examine principles of tension, resistance and causality in solo and partnered work. Building upon this foundation, we will explore free movement and energy exchange in partnered contact improvisation. This dynamic partnered work will inform our exercises in safe and effective fight choreography, including unarmed combat (punches, kicks, falls, rolls, etc.) and an introduction to armed combat (knife work). Each actor will build several movement compositions, which will act as a space to experiment further with elements of personal style and movement vocabulary. There will be three compositional projects: one freestyle piece, one contact improv-based staging, and one blocked scene with fight choreography.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":215075,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"17:05:00","location":""}],"id":58022}],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},

This explosion of creativity has been matched by the increasing visibility and ubiquity of new games and ways of seeing games: as video games, televised professional sports, and even distributed urban events.nn\tnnGames are not a simple object of study.  There are many ways to understand them: as social practices, as formal systems, as representative artwork, as modes of learning, and many more.

However, we will take a deeply interdisciplinary approach to the study of games, and will draw on perspectives from design, philosophy, education, and the emerging discipline of video game studies.  We will also, of course, draw on a variety of games, both online and offline.
