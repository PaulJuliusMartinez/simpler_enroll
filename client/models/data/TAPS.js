The course is divided into two sections. The first concentrates on questions of historiography and the archive as they relate to studies of theater, dance, and performance. We will think about how events have been historicized, how absence has been represented, and how bodies are re-figured and remembered, and we will investigate important principles and best practices of performance documentation and historiography. We will interrogate the dynamics of power and protocol inherent in archives, and we will examine the status of data and various forms of evidence in constructing critical performance history. The second part of the course explores the relationship between performance and ethnography. We will discuss different critical perspectives on ethnographic methods and data gathering, and learn about participant-observation fieldwork and interview techniques, with an emphasis on developing ethical, generative research approaches that are beneficial to the subject as well as to the scholar.

Students will be encouraged to think critically about the relationship between form and content exploring the possibilities of site specific, gallery and theatre settings. Students will reflect throughout on the types of contact and communication uniquely possible in the live moment, such as interaction or the engagement of the senses.  The emphasis is on weekly experimentation in the creation of short works rather than on a final production.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":212232,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Paris, H."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Paris, H."],"location":"Memaud204"}],"id":15246}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},
