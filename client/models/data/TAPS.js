Including those on probation or parole, over seven million adults are currently under correctional supervision in the U.S. - that's 1 in every 50 Americans. The United States also incarcerates more youth than all other countries. Each year approximately 500,000 young people are brought to detention centers, and an estimated 250,000 young people are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults, the majority for non-violent offenses. On any given night in America, 87,000 children are housed in juvenile residential placements, and 10,000 children are held in adult jails and prisons. Despite the magnitude of these numbers, prisons and juvenile detention centers are uniquely closed and sequestered institutions. nThis class works collaboratively with a local juvenile hall to use literature, writing, and performance to explore the lives of incarcerated youth. In the process, students gain an understanding of incarceration on an immediate and personal scale. Stanford students will work directly with students serving sentences at Hillcrest Juvenile Hall, using collaborative writing and performance projects to share their individual experiences and voices. Stanford students will also engage in writing exercises and discussion groups on campus in order to explore their own relationship to freedom and punishment, choices, changes, and mercy. Class readings, screenings, and discussions will foreground the legal, social, and historical contexts surrounding incarceration as well as the social and behavioral changes made possible through arts programming in prisons. In addition to sustained collaborations with incarcerated youth, the class includes workshops with formerly incarcerated artists, authors, and advocates as well as visits to historic and active prison facilities. Taught jointly by a fiction writer and a dance studies historian, and using the template of the hero&iquest;s journey as our guide, we will consider how writing and performance might mediate understandings of crime, punishment, and rehabilitation.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":214227,},

In other words, we will be asking not only what aspects of legal procedure can theater dramatize, but also at which points the court can (and does) come to resemble theater. nnWe will investigate the intricate relationship between law and drama by analyzing a wide range of dramatic works (from Aeschylus's Oresteia to current theater productions that use legal transcripts as their source texts) and accounts of real-life cases.

We will also look at the ever changing relationship with Shakespeare across generations of British theatre artists, including directors such as Peter Brook and Deborah Warner.nIn this class students will explore the relationship between theatre, politics and culture across fascinating eras in British history as well as thinking about the role of theatre in our own lives and social contexts.  We will ask the questions: What is theatre for?  What meaning does it have for a contemporary audience?  How can it reflect our times?  Has the communal audience experience of going to the theatre changed in an age that is dominated by social media and broadcast technology?  Has this changed the way that people make theatre?

What do we as theatre makers want from audiences?nStudents will read plays weekly and also see screenings of several excellent film versions of the plays as well as participating in staged readings of scenes and class discussions.

Taking the term 'Asia-Pacific' as a provocation and point of interrogation, we will assess how theatrical production from this broad area can help us think through questions of nationalism, regionalism, interculturalism, and diaspora, while deepening our appreciation of world theatre history. The first part of the course focuses on theatre in specific sites, covering classical forms from China, Japan, and Indonesia, as well as indigenous theatre and performance from several Pacific Islands, including the Cook Islands, S'moa, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and Hawai`i. The second part of the course centers on the ocean as a dynamic space of mobility, examining a range of recent plays and performances that trace identities on the move and across borders, and which reveal how various Asian and Pacific Islander communities have engaged with each other in locations from Australia to the west coast of the United States.

But in the past 50 years or so, we have seen an explosion of creativity in the development of new games, many of which, especially video games, complicate older understandings of what games are.  This explosion of creativity has been matched by the increasing visibility and ubiquity of new games and ways of seeing games: as video games, televised professional sports, and even distributed urban events.n\tnGames are not a simple object of study.  There are many ways to understand them: as social practices, as formal systems, as representative artwork, as modes of learning, and many more.  We will start by considering games as a mode of performance, considering games in relation to theater and other forms of aesthetic performance.  However, we will take a deeply interdisciplinary approach to the study of games, and will draw on perspectives from design, philosophy, education, and the emerging discipline of video game studies.  We will also, of course, draw on a variety of games, both online and offline.  As we bring in these perspectives, we will begin to consider games in at least two other fundamental ways: as designed experiences and as composed systems or artworks.nnThis course is less an attempt to provide a survey of the entire field of games.  It is more an attempt to provide a basic toolbox for critically examining and analyzing games.  These tools are potentially useful for anyone who interacts with games: whether as a consumer of entertainment, a critical analyst of play, a user of serious games, or a game designer.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215293,},
