This course takes a close look at a diverse range of these contemporary works and explores how to adopt their research and aesthetic strategies for work of your own.  We start with a brief look back at the recent origins of this trend and look at excerpts from forerunners such as Richard Wright, Truman Capote, and Bertolt Brecht.  We then turn to the rise of  documentary fictions in the last few decades and read works by Eggers, Adam Johnson, G.B. Tran, Maria Hummel, and Daniel Alarcon and watch performances by the Tectonic Theater Project and Elevator Repair Service. Students write one analytic essay and then conduct or study interviews to design a work of their own. The course will feature class visits by a number of our authors and a special half-day workshop with Smith.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":217502,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Willihnganz, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Willihnganz, J."],"location":"160-322"}],"id":30685}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

The second part of the course explores the relationship between performance and ethnography. We will discuss different critical perspectives on ethnographic methods and data gathering, including participant-observation fieldwork and interview techniques. This course purposefully blends theory and practice, connecting philosophical discussions to concrete case studies, field trips, and your own research practices.
