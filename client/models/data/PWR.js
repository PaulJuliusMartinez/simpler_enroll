What does the difference between Kendrick Lamar's \"We Gon Be Alright\" and older movement anthems like \"Let Nobody Turn Us Around\" tell us about differences in perspective held by contemporary Black activists and those of other eras? What strategies are people engaged in various kinds of work to \"assert their collective humanity\" and \"gain acceptance for ideas relative to Black survival and Black liberation\" using in the pursuit of those goals? What debates are taking place inside Black communities about activism? About community itself? What is it about twitter, vines and memes that have made those spaces such rich spaces for Black expressive cultures? What stylistic or aesthetic features mark those communicative efforts? Finally, what do young people themselves have to say about activism in this moment? This course will examine Black rhetoric from overtly persuasive political and activist discourse to Scandal watch parties and everyday conversation.

In this course, we will interrogate empathy as an ethical model and a rhetorical strategy for effecting social change. Partisanship is at an all time high in the US, being as ingrained and divisive now as race. And a 2015 poll showed that almost six in ten Americans--heavy majorities of both blacks and whites--believe that \"race relations are generally bad, and nearly four in 10 think the situation is getting worse.\" Stanford's campus has been no stranger to these controversies--divestment from Palestine and fossil fuels, Slow Down for Michael Brown, sexual assault punishments, and accusations of anti-Jewish bias in election endorsements. So, do we need an \"empathy revolution,\" or should we be \"against empathy\" or is it more complicated? To get at these questions, we will read about empathy from the perspective of morality, neuroscience, social movements and rhetoric; and practice compassion meditation. Finally, with the course readings and discussions in mind, you will write about a social change issue you believe might, or might not, benefit from an empathetic framework.

We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story.  This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;nnWe will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles.  In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks and myths from around the world, all voices in the largest conversation we have as humans, the one that asks: who am I? why am I here? what truly matters? how can I be happy?  Together we will investigate how these stories, and stories like them, can be used to help us find our own story.  &lt;b&gt;Students in this course will have a special opportunity to meet personally with poet Billy Collins and singer Aimee Mann when they visit campus in April.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;nnDoes not fulfill NSC requirement.
