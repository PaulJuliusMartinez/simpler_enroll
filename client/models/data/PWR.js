You've had to explain to your parents how your/their tuition dollars are at work, or you've advocated for your well-rounded background during a job interview. Your access to Stanford has granted you a certain expert label, even if it doesn't always feel that way. This course leverages your growing expertise by introducing you to writing styles and genres that will allow you to communicate your technical interests to a non-expert, or popular, audience. We'll talk about stylistic points including story ledes and anecdotes, metaphor, and organizing familiar and non-familiar language in our writing. We'll also experiment with different genres that accomplish these translation goals by experimenting with writing abstracts, journalism pieces, provocative podcasts, first-person narratives, visual essays, and creative non-fiction essays. Our ultimate goal will be to not only better understand these styles and genres in order to communicate more effectively with a wide variety of audiences, but to also seek publication in local newspapers, blogs, and sources such as <i>Salon, Slate, The Huffington Post, The Atlantic,</i> and even <i>Wired</i> or <i>Radiolab</i>.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215938,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Gerben, C."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","instructors":["Gerben, C."],"location":"250-108"}],"id":30527}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Physician, poet and essayist, Lewis Thomas inspires readers to delve into the etymology of scientific discovery, and, in doing so, prompts radical reconsiderations of the cultural significance of innovation. Similarly, neurologist and writer, Oliver Sacks&iquest; compassionate ruminations on mental disability advance fresh thinking on the nature of difference. Inversely, many essayists hailing from &iquest;fuzzy&iquest; backgrounds, deploy techniques usually associated with scientific observation to electrify their prose: To wit, the works of brilliant stylists like Annie Dillard, Chang-rae Lee, and Mark Doty are characterized by the kind of deep observation that underpins scientific inquiry. These writers, like scientists, are first and foremost good at really looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;nnIn this course, we will delve into a fluid, yet rigorous, research process based on the art of observation. Each student will begin the quarter by posing a question of personal or professional significance about how some aspect of the natural, social, technological or cultural world works. Using these questions as a starting point, students will then design a research process to first complicate, and then perhaps also answer, their initial question. The end product of the inquiry will be a self-fashioned experimental essay that can engage a discerning public audience. This is the perfect class for techies, wonks, and data junkies who want to cultivate the poet&iquest;s cherished sensibilities.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"id":215937,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lewis, C."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Lewis, C."],"location":"160-127"}],"id":30526}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
