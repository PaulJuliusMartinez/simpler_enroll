Thematic focus is the history of student activism at Stanford. How have political activities such as demonstrations, assemblies, educational events, and nonviolent civil disobediance been organized on campus, and how have they affected Stanford? What lessons can be drawn from the past for students interested in social change? Students will choose historical periods and/or specific social movements for research. Course will feature guest appearances by representatives from a range of social movements at Stanford the past fifty years, and the building of an online repository and community for the collaborative representation and discussion of history.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":214982,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"19:00:00","end":"21:45:00","location":"200-013"}],"id":57565}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
