{"100":{"department":"SYMSYS","number":"100","title":"Minds and Machines (LINGUIST 144, PHIL 99, PSYCH 35)","description":"An overview of the interdisciplinary study of cognition, information, communication, and language, with an emphasis on foundational issues: What are minds? What is computation? What are rationality and intelligence? Can we predict human behavior? Can computers be truly intelligent? How do people and technology interact, and how might they do so in the future? Lectures focus on how the methods of philosophy, mathematics, empirical research, and computational modeling are used to study minds and machines. Undergraduates considering a major in symbolic systems should take this course as early as possible in their program of study.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["DB-SocSci","WAY-FR"],"id":140838,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:30:00 PM","location":"420-040"}],"id":28918}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"122":{"department":"SYMSYS","number":"122","title":"Artificial Intelligence: Philosophy, Ethics, & Impact (CS 122)","description":"Recent advances in computing may place us at the threshold of a unique turning point in human history. Soon we are likely to entrust management of our environment, economy, security, infrastructure, food production, healthcare, and to a large degree even our personal activities, to artificially intelligent computer systems. The prospect of \"turning over the keys\" to increasingly autonomous systems raises many complex and troubling questions. How will society respond as versatile robots and machine-learning systems displace an ever-expanding spectrum of blue- and white-collar workers? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed or accrue to a lucky few? How can we ensure that these systems respect our ethical principles when they make decisions at speeds and for rationales that exceed our ability to comprehend? What, if any, legal rights and responsibilities should we grant them? And should we regard them merely as sophisticated tools or as a newly emerging form of life? The goal of this course is to equip students with the intellectual tools, ethical foundation, and psychological framework to successfully navigate the coming age of intelligent machines.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":215682,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:30:00 PM","location":"Cubberley Auditorium"}],"id":30622}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
