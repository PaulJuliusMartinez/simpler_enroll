{"110Q":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"110Q","title":"Making Sense of Strategy","description":"Get the strategy right, and the chance for success is great. Nowhere is this more evident than in today's world of major challenges. Strategy is at the heart of problem solving and achieving objectives, yet few people can define strategy, much less understand how to conceptualize, design, and execute effective strategies that yield the best outcomes.This course will meet once a week to focus on interesting and engaging case studies, each of which illustrates a key ingredient of strategy. Some are well-known historical events, while others are less obvious, but all have a strategic lesson to share. They are quite diverse, from the planning of a high-risk rescue in the Colorado Rockies, to a product crisis in a Fortune 50 company, to a little-known failed military mission of WWII, to a commercial airline disaster. The ability to think through challenging and varied scenarios is both instructive and mind-stretching. There will be some pre-reading on each case study and there may be a field trip for students to put their lessons into practice. The course is designed to be highly interactive; all to enable students to unravel the mystery and power of strategic thinking. Students will also have the opportunity to select and analyze a case reflecting interests of their own. This course can help students not only prepare for a career in a range of fields, but also as they meet the challenges of their current coursework. Problem-solving skills are central in every walk of life; this seminar can help students build a stronger foundation for sound decision-making.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212681,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Demarest, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","instructors":["Shaker, S.","Demarest, D."],"location":"GSB Faculty East 102"}],"id":32184}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

"321":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"321","title":"Create a New Venture: From Idea to Launch I","description":"This is an integrated lab course in Entrepreneurship designed to teach students the process of creating a new viable venture - from idea to launch. It is a dynamic and interactive course organized around projects undertaken by teams of 3 to 4 registered students from the MSx and MBA programs, together with other graduate students within Stanford who bring expertise of particular relevance to the idea being pursued. This course is designed not only for students with immediate entrepreneurial aspirations, but also for any student considering starting an entrepreneurial venture at some point in his or her career. The course is a two quarter class, with admission to the class by team and idea. In the winter quarter, teams will research, craft, and morph their idea into a viable business concept. In the spring quarter they will further refine their concept and develop a strategy and plan to attract financial, human and other resources. At the end of the spring quarter, teams will present their plan to a panel of experts and potential investors to simulate the funding process. The new course builds on a predecessor course S356 \"Evaluating Entrepreneurial Opportunities\" and encapsulates new and important research and findings as they relate to the process of new venture creation. The teaching method is primarily learning by doing (LBD) through a structured process and supported by relevant lectures. Learning is further enhanced through meetings with the instructor, coaching by experienced mentors and review by peers. Field research as well as prototype product development are integral to the course. Since admittance to S321/S322 is by team and the quality of their idea, team formation takes place during the autumn quarter. Informal student mixers and seminars will be held to facilitate team formation and idea generation. Each team of 3-4 students should preferably consist of 1 or more MSx students and graduate students from the MBA program or other Schools - Engineering, Medicine, Law, Science, Education - to bring diversity and depth to the team.

"323":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"323","title":"Design Thinking in the Context of Global Scale Organizations","description":"Driving innovation at large global organizations is extremely challenging. As organizations establish and become successful, the culture and processes calcify and resisting changes becomes the norm.  As a result, organizations fail to reframe big problems, identify unmet needs and challenge the status quo.  The goal of this course is to prepare students for design thinking in complex, globally distributed organizations.  Specifically, the goal is to impart students with a personal sense of creative confidence but also (1) be confident in their ability to navigate global scale organizations that are multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural, (2) recognize patterns of resistant behavior, (3) create coalitions of support at different levels of the organization (and externally), (4) be willing to adapt, adjust and even drop what they have learned about design thinking for a particular situation, (5) be patient, gritty and have the tenacity to drive change and (6) leverage technology to come up with design solutions.  Students in this course will work in interdisciplinary teams to work on projects that will be sponsored by external partners including for and non-profit businesses and government agencies.  The projects will be on real world challenges that global scale organizations face and on finding solutions using design thinking principles and technology. This full immersion course provides the opportunity for students to get practical training in design thinking, solve big problems while also figuring out a way to leverage design thinking and technology to create a lasting and global impact.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":216596,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Yen, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","instructors":["Ferrero, M.","Yen, S.","Shiv, B."],"location":"550-STUDIO 2"}],"id":33231}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"376":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"376","title":"Entrepreneur Leader-Identity Development: A Critical-Incident Approach","description":"Entrepreneurship can be an exhaustive experience. This course is structured to provide valuable skills and strategies aimed at enabling aspiring entrepreneurs to mitigate personal burnout while in pursuit of new ventures. In terms of this course, an entrepreneur is defined as a person who risks mobilizing resources to capitalize on a perceived opportunity of value-creation-change. A \"social entrepreneur\" creates social value, a \"business entrepreneur\" creates profit, and a 'hybrid entrepreneur' blends the two. This course will tailor student's class work to fit his or her entrepreneurial orientation. Students who opt to focus their coursework on social or environmental entrepreneurship may petition to have this course count toward the Certificate in Public Management and Social Innovation.  nnResearch is showing that a significant career hazard of entrepreneurship is emotional burnout- exhaustion from raising capital, growing new teams, competing with established players, and more contributes to the challenges of entrepreneurship. The goal of this course is to teach students how to identify and develop an increased capacity in emotional resilience as a means of mitigating burnout in oneself and in the diverse \"community of actors\" one is attempting to mobilize into concerted action aimed at value-creation-change. Research is also showing that one of the key causes of chronic stress is leader-identity development: when men and women of diverse-identities - different from the dominant-identity, engage in value-creation-change within a given community of practice and context, chronic adversity is a given. The effort of diverse-identities to lead value-creation-change introduces a chronic re-evaluation and re-definition of 'leader' within the given culture. From a global perspective this chronic adversity dynamic is especially true for women leaders. For men and women of diverse-identity, this dynamic is a consequence of power inequity. Both the diverse-identity and dominant-identity leader need to strategically anticipate and proactively address this dynamic in order to sustain his or her role as an agent of value-creation-change.nnUsing the \"critical-incident empathetic-inquiry\" approach students will interview aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs on how they successfully recovered from, adapted to, and sustained perseverance in the face of situational and chronic adversity. These interviews will be recorded and analyzed from both a content and emotional decision-making perspective. Particular attention will be paid to how the practice of \"empathetic-inquiry\" in itself is a learnable micro-intervention with the potential of alleviating stress, supporting recovery, and sustaining effort. It is presented, taught, and practiced as a fundamental \"emotional literacy\" entrepreneur leadership skill.nnFrom a diversity perspective, students will also be exploring how unsupported leader-identity development within a given cultural context and community of practice can be a major cause of stress and burnout. Via the \"critical-incident empathetic inquiry\" process students will focus on interviewing and learning from \"exemplars\" with whom they identify, with the aim of learning from \"exemplar's\" personal leader-identity journey.nnThis course enables students to be practitioners of \"empathetic inquiry\" in entrepreneurial contexts in order to provide an added advantage to GSB students pursuing entrepreneurship after graduation and beyond.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214608,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Bristol, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"8:00:00 PM","instructors":["Bristol, S."],"location":""},{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","instructors":["Bristol, S."],"location":"GSB Zambrano 301"}],"id":31079}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"381":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"381","title":"Leading Strategic Change in the Health Care Industry","description":"This seminar provides the opportunity for students to study the structure and dynamics of the U.S. health care industry, and some of the ways it intersects with the global health care industry. The U.S. health care industry represents over 15 percent of the nation's GDP and is rapidly changing as a result of government regulatory reform enacted in 2010. The seminar's aim is to develop participants' ability to create strategically informed action plans that are imaginative, inspiring and workable in this highly dynamic environment. The seminar's pedagogy involves informed debate to evaluate and hone well-researched views by the participants and instructors, as well as the writing and presentation of position papers by small groups of seminar participants on the key dynamics of the industry. In the course of the seminar discussions, we aim to deepen our understanding of strategic dynamics and transformational change at the societal, industry and organizational levels of analysis. After developing a complete picture of the structure of the health care industry and the strategic relationships among the key players - the strategic landscape -, the seminar will focus on how health care reform and other external forces will affect the strategic opportunities and challenges of four types of players in the strategic landscape: (1) Incumbents (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, hospital companies, insurance companies); (2) entrepreneurial startups (e.g., home monitoring, genetic testing companies, information services); (3) cross-boundary disruptors (e.g., health clinics, Wal-Mart, Cisco, Google); and (4) international health care providers (e.g. in Mexico, India, Thailand) Four student teams will be formed to focus on one of the four types of players. Each team will prepare a research paper focused on determining how their type of player can take advantage of the regulatory, technological, social, cultural and demographic changes, and who will be the likely winners and why. During the first round of discussions (sessions 2-5) all participants will take part in examining the different parts of the competitive landscape. During the second round (sessions 6-9), the different teams will present their research findings and perspectives about the strategic opportunities and threats which exist. As part of the second set of sessions, the instructors will bring in domain experts to further augment the discussion.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":211080,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Pearl, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"6:30:00 PM","end":"9:30:00 PM","instructors":["Moore, N.","Pearl, R.","Burgelman, R."],"location":"GSB Faculty East 102"}],"id":29474}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
