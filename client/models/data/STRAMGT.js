{"110Q":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"110Q","title":"Making Sense of Strategy","description":"Get the strategy right, and the chance for success is great. Nowhere is this more evident than in today's world of major challenges. Strategy is at the heart of problem solving and achieving objectives, yet few people can define strategy, much less understand how to conceptualize, design, and execute effective strategies that yield the best outcomes.This course will meet once a week to focus on interesting and engaging case studies, each of which illustrates a key ingredient of strategy. Some are well-known historical events, while others are less obvious, but all have a strategic lesson to share. They are quite diverse, from the planning of a high-risk rescue in the Colorado Rockies, to a product crisis in a Fortune 50 company, to a little-known failed military mission of WWII, to a commercial airline disaster. The ability to think through challenging and varied scenarios is both instructive and mind-stretching. There will be some pre-reading on each case study and there may be a field trip for students to put their lessons into practice. The course is designed to be highly interactive; all to enable students to unravel the mystery and power of strategic thinking. Students will also have the opportunity to select and analyze a case reflecting interests of their own. This course can help students not only prepare for a career in a range of fields, but also as they meet the challenges of their current coursework. Problem-solving skills are central in every walk of life; this seminar can help students build a stronger foundation for sound decision-making.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212681,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Demarest, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Shaker, S.","Demarest, D."],"location":"GSB Class of 1968 101"}],"id":45394}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
"306":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"306","title":"Food Innovation and Entrepreneurship","description":"Americans spend nearly 7% of their income on food items and another 5% on food services annually (US Census). Food spend is at the intersection of two of the most important industries in the US: health care and agriculture. Food production today supports the food consumption causing our extraordinary burden of disease; 75 cents of every dollar of the $4.8 billion spent annually on health care is for diet-related disease. The health care system accounts for over 17% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Agriculture and agriculture-related industries contributed 4.8% to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.nThis course focuses on the opportunities across these industries for food, health, and nutrition entrepreneurship. The course is designed for students with a broad interest in the food or health systems and/or who are interested in careers in food-related fields.nnWe will examine the food system from three points of view: the consumer, nutritional science, and policy.

"321":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"321","title":"Create a New Venture: From Idea to Launch I","description":"This is an integrated lab course in Entrepreneurship designed to teach students the process of creating a new viable venture - from idea to launch. It is a dynamic and interactive course organized around projects undertaken by teams of 3 to 4 registered students from the MSx and MBA programs, together with other graduate students within Stanford who bring expertise of particular relevance to the idea being pursued. This course is designed not only for students with immediate entrepreneurial aspirations, but also for any student considering starting an entrepreneurial venture at some point in his or her career. The course is a two quarter class, with admission to the class by team and idea. In the winter quarter, teams will research, craft, and morph their idea into a viable business concept. In the spring quarter they will further refine their concept and develop a strategy and plan to attract financial, human and other resources. At the end of the spring quarter, teams will present their plan to a panel of experts and potential investors to simulate the funding process. The new course builds on a predecessor course S356 \"Evaluating Entrepreneurial Opportunities\" and encapsulates new and important research and findings as they relate to the process of new venture creation. The teaching method is primarily learning by doing (LBD) through a structured process and supported by relevant lectures. Learning is further enhanced through meetings with the instructor, coaching by experienced mentors and review by peers. Field research as well as prototype product development are integral to the course. Since admittance to S321/S322 is by team and the quality of their idea, team formation takes place during the autumn quarter. Informal student mixers and seminars will be held to facilitate team formation and idea generation. Each team of 3-4 students should preferably consist of 1 or more MSx students and graduate students from the MBA program or other Schools - Engineering, Medicine, Law, Science, Education - to bring diversity and depth to the team.

Each class further confirmed the importance of the design thinking process, methodology, and community. By the end of her Stanford career she truly believed that design thinking had the potential to change her life.n nAs graduation approached, Samantha found a position at a large tech company in Silicon Valley and was excited to bring the design thinking methodologies with her. A few weeks into her new job, she asked her team if they wanted to talk to some users before launching into their next big project. She was met with a room of blank stares and apprehensive questions. n nHow might we give Samantha the skills she needs to change the mindset of her colleagues, spark design thinking at her company, and get her first design-driven project off the ground?  n nWhen you take a class at the d.school, you walk away confident in your creative skills and fluent in the design process. However, when recent graduates (re)enter the workforce, they quickly become discouraged by the stagnancy of company cultures. They see the need to trigger and sustain change, but don&iquest;t have the understanding of organizational psychology to do so. Organizational Psychology of Design Thinking asks you to take on Samantha&iquest;s challenges. n nOver the course of the semester, students will engage in 2 large-scale projects:n- Project 1 (Empathy - Synthesis) - Working with partner companies, students will apply organizational psychology and design frameworks to better understand company culture.n- Project 2 (Ideation - Testing) - Using their work from Project 1, students will prototype and test organizational changes in real company settings.nn**Please note** Our class will take an experimental approach Organizational Psychology of Design Thinking.

"376":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"376","title":"Developing Entrepreneur Emotional Resilience","description":"A fundamental challenge of an entrepreneur is the chronic emotional adversity new leaders face, at a task, relationship, and identity development (diversity) level. This class applies to both social entrepreneurs and business entrepreneurs. n nThis developmental flow of this course draws heavily on Goleman's emotional intelligence skills developed in OB 374: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Student's completing this class have called it 'touchy feely for entrepreneurs'.nnThe goal of this class is to learn to identify, build on, and leverage one's personal emotional resilience schema. Emotional resilience is the capacity to 'successfully adapt to emotional adversity'. When emotionally flooded decision-making is significantly impaired. Creative problem solving and teamwork are severely compromised. The capacity to down-regulate physiological arousal when emotionally 'flooded' by adversity and regain one's equilibrium of perception is a learnable skill. It is an intentional extension of one's personal emotional resilience schema. For an entrepreneur it is also a strategic advantage. Just as individuals can become emotionally flooded and incapacitated by adversity so can teams.  In this 'flooded' state individuals and teams fall back on coping patterns of action. When what is most needed is timely and intentional  'down-regulating' behaviors: 1) self-soothing, and 2) co-soothing, that achieve emotional equilibrium. Students will engage in one-on-one interviews to identify different soothing strategies and resilience schema's learned by themselves, classmates, and experienced entrepreneurs.n nTo achieve this goal four educational behaviors will be engaged:n1.\tLearning one-on-one 'critical incident' interview skills that facilitate empathic-inquiry, emotional disclosure,  pattern discovery and adaptive-reflection.n2.\tIdentify one's present 'emotional resilience schema'.n3.\tUse critical incident interview skills to identify other entrepreneur's 'emotional resilience schema'. n4.\tIdentify student's incidents of adaptive-reflection documented in submitted reflection journals (1-4) and summarize student's personal 'emotional resilience schema' growth trend.nnThis class is structured around Five Critical Incident (one-on-one) Interviews that the student will participate in. Each interview will be digitally taped and a copy saved by the student for review and analysis and submitted with each respective reflection journal (5).  Students are expected to complete a 1000 word Emotional Resilience Reflection Journal entry summarizing their leanings from each of the Five Critical Incident Interviews.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214608,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Mattish, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"8:00:00 PM","instructors":["Mattish, P.","Bristol, S."],"location":""},{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Bristol, S.","Mattish, P."],"location":"GSB Class of 1968 110"}],"id":46218}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"381":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"381","title":"Leading Strategic Change in the Health Care Industry","description":"This seminar provides the opportunity for students to study the structure and dynamics of the U.S. health care industry, and some of the ways it intersects with the global health care industry. The U.S. health care industry represents over 15 percent of the nation's GDP and is rapidly changing as a result of government regulatory reform enacted in 2010. The seminar's aim is to develop participants' ability to create strategically informed action plans that are imaginative, inspiring and workable in this highly dynamic environment. The seminar's pedagogy involves informed debate to evaluate and hone well-researched views by the participants and instructors, as well as the writing and presentation of position papers by small groups of seminar participants on the key dynamics of the industry. In the course of the seminar discussions, we aim to deepen our understanding of strategic dynamics and transformational change at the societal, industry and organizational levels of analysis. After developing a complete picture of the structure of the health care industry and the strategic relationships among the key players - the strategic landscape -, the seminar will focus on how health care reform and other external forces will affect the strategic opportunities and challenges of four types of players in the strategic landscape: (1) Incumbents (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, hospital companies, insurance companies); (2) entrepreneurial startups (e.g., home monitoring, genetic testing companies, information services); (3) cross-boundary disruptors (e.g., health clinics, Wal-Mart, Cisco, Google); and (4) international health care providers (e.g. in Mexico, India, Thailand) Four student teams will be formed to focus on one of the four types of players. Each team will prepare a research paper focused on determining how their type of player can take advantage of the regulatory, technological, social, cultural and demographic changes, and who will be the likely winners and why. During the first round of discussions (sessions 2-5) all participants will take part in examining the different parts of the competitive landscape. During the second round (sessions 6-9), the different teams will present their research findings and perspectives about the strategic opportunities and threats which exist. As part of the second set of sessions, the instructors will bring in domain experts to further augment the discussion.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":211080,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Moore, N."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"6:30:00 PM","end":"9:30:00 PM","instructors":["Burgelman, R.","Moore, N.","Pearl, R."],"location":"GSB Faculty East 102"}],"id":27470}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
