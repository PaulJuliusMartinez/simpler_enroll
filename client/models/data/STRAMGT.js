{"110Q":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"110Q","title":"Making Sense of Strategy","description":"Get the strategy right, and the chance for success is great. Nowhere is this more evident than in today's world of major challenges. Strategy is at the heart of problem solving and achieving objectives, yet few people can define strategy, much less understand how to conceptualize, design, and execute effective strategies that yield the best outcomes.This course will meet once a week to focus on interesting and engaging case studies, each of which illustrates a key ingredient of strategy. Some are well-known historical events, while others are less obvious, but all have a strategic lesson to share. They are quite diverse, from the planning of a high-risk rescue in the Colorado Rockies, to a product crisis in a Fortune 50 company, to a little-known failed military mission of WWII, to a commercial airline disaster. The ability to think through challenging and varied scenarios is both instructive and mind-stretching. There will be some pre-reading on each case study and there may be a field trip for students to put their lessons into practice. The course is designed to be highly interactive; all to enable students to unravel the mystery and power of strategic thinking. Students will also have the opportunity to select and analyze a case reflecting interests of their own. This course can help students not only prepare for a career in a range of fields, but also as they meet the challenges of their current coursework. Problem-solving skills are central in every walk of life; this seminar can help students build a stronger foundation for sound decision-making.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212681,},

However, rather than tackle cases where you can distance yourself in comfortable analytical discussions, we throw you into experiential exercises, testing your ability to build effective relationships, motivate others, and influence outcomes. The Leadership Labs are designed for deep self-reflection about what behaviors you choose to use, the consequences of those behaviors, and given choices, how you might be even more productive.nnnIn total, there are ten Leadership Lab Sessions--six, three-hour Interpersonal Skills Labs, and four, 90-minute Managerial Skills Labs. The Interpersonal Skills Labs sessions are comprised of short lectures and increasingly challenging simulations and role-plays facilitated by the Arbuckle Leadership Fellows. The Leadership Fellows are second-year GSB students who have participated in a rigorous training program that prepares them to facilitate the exercises and cases used in the Interpersonal Skills Labs.nnnIn the 90-minute Managerial Skills Labs we examine several common managerial challenges faced by executives. Together with Faculty, students explore these topics using four case examples, each asking students to evaluate a series of situations, develop alternatives for their resolution, and ultimately recommend and implement a course of action from the point of view of the company's owner/manager. We have selected small to midsized businesses as the context for these discussions in order to highlight the impact that key decisions and their implementation can have on the broader organization.

"359":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"359","title":"Aligning Start-ups with their Market","description":"Most everyone associated with technology start-ups would agree that the most important initial characteristic of a successful endeavor is a compelling vision. The journey from vision to escape velocity is highly dependent on management's ability to translate that vision into a product or service that closely and economically addresses a customer's significant point of pain. Without a tight product market fit, the start-up's offering will not be able to break through the market's gravitational forces which strongly favor existing solutions, resulting in likely failure. With tight product/market fit, it is far more likely the company will achieve repeatable and growing sales success. Conventional wisdom dictates that a start-up launching a new product should focus its energy understanding what the market wants (problem) and then translating that knowledge into an optimal set of product features (solution). This is the ideal strategy if one is attacking a market that already exists. However if the start-up pursues an entirely new market or re-segments an existing market, customers are unlikely to be able to articulate the benefits and features they will need. The approaches required to pursue new or re-segmented markets are radically different from those applied to existing markets. As a result it is not relentless execution and exploitation of a well understood market that will lead to success, but discovery of a new market or segment that is in need of the product as envisioned. If done well, this process of finding the optimal product/market fit has a disproportionate impact on success. Our intention is to create a course that explores the many issues associated with optimizing product/market fit. Two group papers comprise 50% of a student's grade with class participation representing the remainder.

"367":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"367","title":"Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation","description":"This course examines individuals and organizations that use entrepreneurial skills and approaches to develop innovative responses to social problems. Entrepreneurship has traditionally been seen as a way of creating wealth for the entrepreneur and for those who back her/his work. Social entrepreneurs employ \"entrepreneurial skills,\" such as finding opportunities, inventing new approaches, securing and focusing resources and managing risk, in the service of creating a social value. As the intensity and complexity of social and environmental problems has grown in recent years social entrepreneurship, defined as innovative, social value creating activity that can occur within or across the nonprofit, government or business sectors, has become increasingly prominent. While virtually all enterprises, commercial and social, generate social value, fundamental to this definition is that the primary focus of social entrepreneurship is to achieve social impact above all else. We will study some of the most promising and the best-proven innovations for improving people's lives. We will also examine mature projects that are now tackling the issue of \"scale\", moving from local innovations to solutions that create deep systemic changes for larger numbers of economically disadvantaged individuals and communities throughout the world. This year we will focus on what are the constraints and opportunities for creating a social enterprise at scale. nn nnThe process of \"scale\" poses tremendous challenges. Even when organizations manage to overcome the many obstacles to growth, and achieve appreciable scale, this approach is seldom sufficient to achieve significant social impact on its own.

The students will also be introduced to core managerial issues uniquely defined by this sector such as development/fundraising, investment management, performance management and nonprofit finance. The course also provides an overview of the sector, including its history and economics. Cases involve a range of nonprofits, from smaller, social entrepreneurial to larger, more traditional organizations, including education, social service, environment, health care, religion, NGO's and performing arts. In exploring these issues, this course reinforces the frameworks and concepts of strategic management introduced in the core first year courses. In addition to case discussions, the course employs role plays, study group exercises and many outsider speakers.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":101041,},
"369":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"369","title":"Social Entrepreneurship","description":"This course is about the efforts of private citizens to create effective responses to social needs and innovative solutions to social problems. History is full of examples of this kind of activity, though its character continues to evolve. Social entrepreneurs are increasingly blurring the lines between the sectors, using for-profit and hybrid forms of organization to achieve social objectives. This creates new opportunities for applying business skills in the social sector. Despite its prominence and complexity, this combination of private initiative and public purpose is not well understood. The objectives of this course are: (1) to introduce students to the concepts, practices, and challenges of social entrepreneurship in the United States and around the world; (2) to equip students with frameworks and tools that will help them be more effective in their socially entrepreneurial pursuits, and (3) to engage students in a joint learning process as a better understanding of this emerging field is developed by all in this class.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":101044,},

The seminar's pedagogy involves informed debate to evaluate and hone well-researched views by the participants and instructors, as well as the writing and presentation of position papers by small groups of seminar participants on the seminar's focal theme. Andy Grove will continue to participate as co-instructor of the seminar, but at a reduced level. In the course of the seminar discussions, we aim to deepen our understanding of strategic dynamics and transformational change at the societal, industry and organizational levels of analysis.nnnIn fall 2010, the focal theme of the seminar will be \"The Future Role of Silicon Valley: Prospective Strategic Analyses.\" Within the overarching theme, we will research four sub-themes. Domain experts for three of the sub-themes have committed to co-leading the related sessions with the instructors (see below). nnnThe four sub-themes are:nn1. The role of Silicon Valley in the future of the semiconductor industry. George Cogan, Partner at Bain & Company and expert of the semiconductor industry, will co-lead this sub-theme.nn2. The role of Silicon Valley in the future of the computer industry. Tien Tzuo, CEO of Zuora Inc. and expert of SaaS and cloud computing, will co-lead this sub-theme.nn3. The role of Silicon Valley in the future of the automotive industry. Sven Beiker, Executive Director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford - CARS, will co-lead this sub-theme.nn4. The role of Silicon Valley in the future of U.S. Employment. Andy Grove will lead this sub-theme.nnnTwo seminar sessions will be devoted to each sub-theme. The first session will be led by the instructors. It will involve discussion of reading material and data and focus on refining the key research questions for the sub-theme. The second session (4 weeks later) will be led by the student team carrying out research on that sub-theme. nnnSeminar participants will organize into four teams, each one focused on a sub-theme. Each team will research the forces that are shaping the evolving role of Silicon Valley in relation to their sub-theme, try to assess the implications of that evolution for the future of the U.S. economy, and propose executable recommendations for strengthening Silicon Valley's future role. Each team will be expected to produce a monograph (10-15 pages) presenting and discussing its findings and recommendations, to be handed in at the end of the quarter.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":203279,},
"376":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"376","title":"Entrepreneur Leader-Identity Development: A Critical-Incident Approach","description":"Entrepreneurship can be an exhaustive experience. This course is structured to provide valuable skills and strategies aimed at enabling aspiring entrepreneurs to mitigate personal burnout while in pursuit of new ventures. In terms of this course, an entrepreneur is defined as a person who risks mobilizing resources to capitalize on a perceived opportunity of value-creation-change. A \"social entrepreneur\" creates social value, a \"business entrepreneur\" creates profit, and a 'hybrid entrepreneur' blends the two. This course will tailor student's class work to fit his or her entrepreneurial orientation. Students who opt to focus their coursework on social or environmental entrepreneurship may petition to have this course count toward the Certificate in Public Management and Social Innovation.  nnResearch is showing that a significant career hazard of entrepreneurship is emotional burnout- exhaustion from raising capital, growing new teams, competing with established players, and more contributes to the challenges of entrepreneurship. The goal of this course is to teach students how to identify and develop an increased capacity in emotional resilience as a means of mitigating burnout in oneself and in the diverse \"community of actors\" one is attempting to mobilize into concerted action aimed at value-creation-change. Research is also showing that one of the key causes of chronic stress is leader-identity development: when men and women of diverse-identities - different from the dominant-identity, engage in value-creation-change within a given community of practice and context, chronic adversity is a given. The effort of diverse-identities to lead value-creation-change introduces a chronic re-evaluation and re-definition of 'leader' within the given culture. From a global perspective this chronic adversity dynamic is especially true for women leaders. For men and women of diverse-identity, this dynamic is a consequence of power inequity. Both the diverse-identity and dominant-identity leader need to strategically anticipate and proactively address this dynamic in order to sustain his or her role as an agent of value-creation-change.nnUsing the \"critical-incident empathetic-inquiry\" approach students will interview aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs on how they successfully recovered from, adapted to, and sustained perseverance in the face of situational and chronic adversity. These interviews will be recorded and analyzed from both a content and emotional decision-making perspective. Particular attention will be paid to how the practice of \"empathetic-inquiry\" in itself is a learnable micro-intervention with the potential of alleviating stress, supporting recovery, and sustaining effort. It is presented, taught, and practiced as a fundamental \"emotional literacy\" entrepreneur leadership skill.nnFrom a diversity perspective, students will also be exploring how unsupported leader-identity development within a given cultural context and community of practice can be a major cause of stress and burnout. Via the \"critical-incident empathetic inquiry\" process students will focus on interviewing and learning from \"exemplars\" with whom they identify, with the aim of learning from \"exemplar's\" personal leader-identity journey.nnThis course enables students to be practitioners of \"empathetic inquiry\" in entrepreneurial contexts in order to provide an added advantage to GSB students pursuing entrepreneurship after graduation and beyond.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214608,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"8:00:00 PM","location":""},{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":31079}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

"381":{"department":"STRAMGT","number":"381","title":"Leading Strategic Change in the Health Care Industry","description":"This seminar provides the opportunity for students to study the structure and dynamics of the U.S. health care industry, and some of the ways it intersects with the global health care industry. The U.S. health care industry represents over 15 percent of the nation's GDP and is rapidly changing as a result of government regulatory reform enacted in 2010. The seminar's aim is to develop participants' ability to create strategically informed action plans that are imaginative, inspiring and workable in this highly dynamic environment. The seminar's pedagogy involves informed debate to evaluate and hone well-researched views by the participants and instructors, as well as the writing and presentation of position papers by small groups of seminar participants on the key dynamics of the industry. In the course of the seminar discussions, we aim to deepen our understanding of strategic dynamics and transformational change at the societal, industry and organizational levels of analysis. After developing a complete picture of the structure of the health care industry and the strategic relationships among the key players - the strategic landscape -, the seminar will focus on how health care reform and other external forces will affect the strategic opportunities and challenges of four types of players in the strategic landscape: (1) Incumbents (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, hospital companies, insurance companies); (2) entrepreneurial startups (e.g., home monitoring, genetic testing companies, information services); (3) cross-boundary disruptors (e.g., health clinics, Wal-Mart, Cisco, Google); and (4) international health care providers (e.g. in Mexico, India, Thailand) Four student teams will be formed to focus on one of the four types of players. Each team will prepare a research paper focused on determining how their type of player can take advantage of the regulatory, technological, social, cultural and demographic changes, and who will be the likely winners and why. During the first round of discussions (sessions 2-5) all participants will take part in examining the different parts of the competitive landscape. During the second round (sessions 6-9), the different teams will present their research findings and perspectives about the strategic opportunities and threats which exist. As part of the second set of sessions, the instructors will bring in domain experts to further augment the discussion.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":211080,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"6:30:00 PM","end":"9:30:00 PM","location":"GSB Faculty East 102"}],"id":29474}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
