{"239":{"department":"POLECON","number":"239","title":"MSx: Strategy Beyond Markets","description":"This course addresses managerial issues in the social, political, legal, and ethical environments of business. Cases and readings emphasize strategies to improve the performance of companies in light of their multiple constituencies, in both international and US environments.nnnMost core courses focus on firms' interactions with customers, suppliers, and alliance partners in the form of mutually beneficial voluntary exchange transacted in markets. In contrast, this course considers the strategic interactions of firms with comparably important constituents, organizations, and institutions beyond markets. Issues considered include those involving activist and interest groups, the media, legislatures, regulatory and antitrust agencies, and international organizations such as the WTO.nnnIn many of the class sessions, we will draw on theoretical and empirical research in political economy, a field that is particularly relevant for understanding relationships between firms and governments, because (unlike most of economics) political economy focuses on interactions that are neither voluntary nor transacted via money.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":100763,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Callander, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,true],"start":"8:00:00 AM","end":"9:45:00 AM","instructors":["Broockman, D.","Callander, S.","Summers, M."],"location":"GSB Patterson 102"}],"id":27526},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Summers, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"11:45:00 AM","instructors":["Callander, S.","Summers, M."],"location":"GSB Patterson 102"}],"id":27527}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"342":{"department":"POLECON","number":"342","title":"Finding Spiritual Meaning at Work: Business Exemplars","description":"This course explores the experience of respected business leaders who have been able to integrate their spiritual and business lives successfully.  It also provides an explicit opportunity for students to discuss their own intentions to find deep meaning in and through their business careers.  Difficulties, struggles and barriers will be examined as well.  Readings will include both biographies of specific business people and background materials on the major religious and philosophical traditions represented.  A number of the exemplars whose biographical information will be examined, like Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, will be invited to class -- initially to listen to the class discussion, and then to provide feedback to students, expand on their own biographies and the background resources read in preparation for each class, and respond to questions and answers.  This course will help students elucidate how their business careers fit into what ultimately matters most to them and how to build moral courage and long-term commitment to their ideals.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217022,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["McLennan, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Lion, C.","McLennan, S."],"location":"GSB Faculty East 102"}],"id":27456}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"349":{"department":"POLECON","number":"349","title":"The Business World: Moral and Spiritual Inquiry through Literature","description":"This course uses novels and plays as a basis for examining the moral and spiritual aspects of business leadership and of the environment in which business is done. On the one hand literature is used as the basis for examining the character of business people, while on the other hand literature provides illumination of the cultural contexts of values and beliefs within which commercial activities take place in a global economy. The course is organized around the interplay of religious traditions and national identities. Classes are taught in a Socratic, discussion-based style, creating as much of a seminar atmosphere as possible. A two-text method is used, encouraging students to examine their own personal stories with as much care as the stories presented in the literature. This course will be graded on the basis of class participation, weekly reflection papers (1 page), and a final paper. There will be no exam.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":202806,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lion, C."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["McLennan, S.","Lion, C."],"location":"GSB Faculty East 104"}],"id":46214}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"351":{"department":"POLECON","number":"351","title":"Global Business:  Unspoken Rules of the Game","description":"This course will provide both theoretical and practical assistance to students who will be engaged in global business -- in terms of understanding and negotiating issues of custom, cultural ethos, and underlying religious traditions which are often unspoken but critical to business success.  Frameworks and modes of analysis will be presented that can be used universally, but then will be applied concretely, through case studies, to business contexts in China, Japan, India, the Middle East, Israel, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the United States.  Background information will be included on major religious traditions involved, like Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity.  The class will be discussion-based, drawing on students' own life experience as well as that of invited guests who are personally familiar with business practices in various parts of the world.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217349,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lion, C."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["McLennan, S.","Lion, C."],"location":"GSB Faculty East 102"}],"id":45416}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
