{"239":{"department":"POLECON","number":"239","title":"MSx: Strategy Beyond Markets","description":"This course addresses managerial issues in the social, political, legal, and ethical environments of business. Cases and readings emphasize strategies to improve the performance of companies in light of their multiple constituencies, in both international and US environments.nnMost core courses focus on firms' interactions with customers, suppliers, and alliance partners in the form of mutually beneficial voluntary exchange transacted in markets. In contrast, this course considers the strategic interactions of firms with comparably important constituents, organizations, and institutions beyond markets. Issues considered include those involving activist and interest groups, the media, legislatures, regulatory and antitrust agencies, and international organizations such as the WTO.nnIn many of the class sessions, we will draw on theoretical and empirical research in political economy, a field that is particularly relevant for understanding relationships between firms and governments, because (unlike most of economics) political economy focuses on interactions that are neither voluntary nor transacted via money.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":100763,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Foarta, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"8:00:00 AM","end":"9:45:00 AM","instructors":["Foarta, D.","Callander, S.","Summers, M."],"location":"GSB Gunn 101"}],"id":31076},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Callander, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"3:00:00 PM","instructors":["Callander, S.","Summers, M."],"location":"GSB Gunn 101"}],"id":31077}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
