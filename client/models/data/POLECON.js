"231":{"department":"POLECON","number":"231","title":"Strategy Beyond Markets: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Economies","description":"This course shares significant material with POLECON 230 and the goal of developing integrated strategies for optimal firm performance that combine elements within and beyond markets.  POLECON 231 diverges from the base course to delve deeper into issues that are particularly salient for entrepreneurs in emerging and frontier markets.  Using a combination of cases from developed and developing countries, we will expand the list of topics considered to include managing political risk and protecting the firm in the face of uncertain and discretionary regulatory environments.  The objective is to provide a solid grounding in the techniques explored in 230, while refining skill sets and whetting appetites for investment in higher risk environments.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212733,},
"232":{"department":"POLECON","number":"232","title":"Law and Economics for Corporate Strategy","description":"This course introduces students to the core issues of law and economics and their applications to managerial strategy. Markets and the legal environment are increasingly interrelated: issues such as antitrust, intellectual property, privacy rights, product regulation, and torts affect firms' profitability both directly through legal action and indirectly by determining the \"rules of the game.\" Nor are companies simply reactive to legal and political forces; actions taken by managers in firms often propel issues before the public eye. For instance, electronic collection and collation of personal data has stimulated new concerns about privacy, while court decisions, new legislation, and public opinion have all played roles in determining what is acceptable. Such legal and political forces invariably necessitate changes in corporate strategy, and the effectiveness of corporate strategy often rests on managers' ability to anticipate, rather than simply react to, developments in the nonmarket environment. nnnCases and readings consider specific legal principles and how executives can anticipate, and take effective action with regards to, the threats and opportunities they present. The course will focus on legal doctrine within the United States, but will also consider the legal ramifications of corporate actions with regards to other nations and international law. The course also considers other important nonmarket issues, such as responding to pressure from independent interest groups and understanding how firms may influence the legislative process, though in less depth than Nonmarket Strategy.nnnStudents are expected to come to class with a thorough understanding of the both the legal issues involved and the economic considerations of the case under discussion. By the end of the course, students will have acquired a thorough understanding of the legal principles covered, as well as a strategic acuity regarding the appropriate market and nonmarket responses. Grades will be based on student's demonstration of this understanding through class participation and a final exam.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":208047,},
"239":{"department":"POLECON","number":"239","title":"MSx: Strategy Beyond Markets","description":"This course addresses managerial issues in the social, political, legal, and ethical environments of business. Cases and readings emphasize strategies to improve the performance of companies in light of their multiple constituencies, in both international and US environments.nnMost core courses focus on firms' interactions with customers, suppliers, and alliance partners in the form of mutually beneficial voluntary exchange transacted in markets. In contrast, this course considers the strategic interactions of firms with comparably important constituents, organizations, and institutions beyond markets. Issues considered include those involving activist and interest groups, the media, legislatures, regulatory and antitrust agencies, and international organizations such as the WTO.nnIn many of the class sessions, we will draw on theoretical and empirical research in political economy, a field that is particularly relevant for understanding relationships between firms and governments, because (unlike most of economics) political economy focuses on interactions that are neither voluntary nor transacted via money.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":100763,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"3:00:00 PM","location":""}],"id":31077},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"8:00:00 AM","end":"9:45:00 AM","location":""}],"id":31076}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

"349":{"department":"POLECON","number":"349","title":"The Business World: Moral and Spiritual Inquiry through Literature","description":"This course uses novels and plays as a basis for examining the moral and spiritual aspects of business leadership and of the environment in which business is done. On the one hand literature is used as the basis for examining the character of business people, while on the other hand literature provides illumination of the cultural contexts of values and beliefs within which commercial activities take place in a global economy. The course is organized around the interplay of religious traditions and national identities. Classes are taught in a Socratic, discussion-based style, creating as much of a seminar atmosphere as possible. A two-text method is used, encouraging students to examine their own personal stories with as much care as the stories presented in the literature. This course will be graded on the basis of class participation and a final paper. There will be no exam.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":202806,}}
