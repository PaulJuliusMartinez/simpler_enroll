"123N":{"department":"ARTHIST","number":"123N","title":"Thinking about Visual Attention : from Balzac to Facebook","description":"Writing in 1829, the French author Honoré de Balzac celebrated the acute visual attention of the flâneur, a character he closely associates with modern life: \"To flâne is to take pleasure, to collect flashes of wit, to admire sublime scenes of unhappiness, of love, of joy as well as graceful or grotesque portraits, to thrust one's attention into the depths of a thousand lives.\" In July 2012 the Huffington Report pointed to a fact of modern life: \"On city streets, in suburban parking lots and in shopping centers, there is usually someone strolling while talking on a phone, texting with his head down, listening to music, or playing a video game. The problem isn't as widely discussed as distracted driving, but the danger is real.\" These two very different ways of circulating in urban space suggest that a major shift in how we humans relate to our environment has occurred over the course of nearly two centuries--especially in the densely populated spaces of modern cities. Where the great spectacle of urban life was a marvel of the nineteenth century, today's inhabitants want mainly to block it out by insulating themselves in a cocoon of favorite music or personal conversation, whether by voice or text, that they risk stepping into traffic, colliding with lightposts, or bumping into others similarly self-absorbed. This seminar proposes to think about the hows and whys of that important shift from the unique perspective of art history, a field of study especially attuned to the limits and exigencies of visual acuity. We will explore the topic across a range of media, from daguerreotypes to stereoscopes, from paintings to films, from television screen to the hand-held displays of our smartphones.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-AII"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:45:00"}]}],[],[]]},

The view according to which the expression of religious convictions and arguments must have a place in the political sphere is dominant in political philosophy. By contrast, the \"laicist\" view, which is common in Mexico and in France, holds that such an expression must be absent from the institutions of the State as well as from political discourse. This course examines the reasons that motivate the differences between these two views, such as the assumption of a strong religious pluralism in the former and the presupposition of a dominant church and religion in the latter.  \tThe course is organized in four parts. In the first part we will consider two kinds of political secularization following the well known characterization by Charles Taylor: the \"common ground' and the \"independent ethic\" approaches. We will see how these two approaches result in the two views on the relation between religion and politics mentioned above. In the second part, we will study John Rawls's influential view on the place of religious argument in legal and judicial reasoning in his theory of \"public reason.\" We will contrast this view with Jürgen Habermas's defense of a wide role for religious argument in the public sphere. We will devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the third part, we will turn to the laicist view in the work of both French and Mexican scholars. We will focus on the reasons that motivate a laicist State (Estado laico) and examine whether they still hold. We will examine how the growth of religious pluralism in societies formerly dominated by one single church and religion has forced revisions in the understanding of laicism. We will also devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will consider the implications of these two views on the relation between religion and politics for public schooling, religious freedom, and the separation of Church and State.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]]},

Authors frequently sought to determine the identity and uniqueness of their own cultures by contrasting them against the 'otherness' of their imagined subjects.

The view according to which the expression of religious convictions and arguments must have a place in the political sphere is dominant in political philosophy. By contrast, the \"laicist\" view, which is common in Mexico and in France, holds that such an expression must be absent from the institutions of the State as well as from political discourse. This course examines the reasons that motivate the differences between these two views, such as the assumption of a strong religious pluralism in the former and the presupposition of a dominant church and religion in the latter.  \tThe course is organized in four parts. In the first part we will consider two kinds of political secularization following the well known characterization by Charles Taylor: the \"common ground' and the \"independent ethic\" approaches. We will see how these two approaches result in the two views on the relation between religion and politics mentioned above. In the second part, we will study John Rawls's influential view on the place of religious argument in legal and judicial reasoning in his theory of \"public reason.\" We will contrast this view with Jürgen Habermas's defense of a wide role for religious argument in the public sphere. We will devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the third part, we will turn to the laicist view in the work of both French and Mexican scholars. We will focus on the reasons that motivate a laicist State (Estado laico) and examine whether they still hold. We will examine how the growth of religious pluralism in societies formerly dominated by one single church and religion has forced revisions in the understanding of laicism. We will also devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will consider the implications of these two views on the relation between religion and politics for public schooling, religious freedom, and the separation of Church and State.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]]},

Course content will be framed by the creation of the Bill of Rights (ratified in 1791) and the evisceration of the First Amendment in the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the first instance of what historian Richard J. Hofstader famously called \"the paranoid style in American politics.\"  We will explore the 1790s through 1) an examination of the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debates concerning the pros and cons of establishing a national government rather than a confederation of states; 2) the range of American and British responses to the French Revolution; 3) the growth of democratic radicalism in Anglo-America; 4) the fear of radical-democratic infiltration of the United States from the European Continent, Ireland, and Haiti; and 5) the American literary expression of these questions written in the late 1790s, on the cusp of the post-revolutionary and \"early national\" eras.  Our overall goal is to gain a historical understanding of the overlapping cultural contexts for American ¿republicanism,¿ ¿democracy,¿ and ¿liberalism,¿ and the evolution of their meanings.  We will focus particularly on the co-production of democratic and novelistic subjectivity in relation to natural right theory, the evolution of \"conscience,\" voice, the body, individuation, sovereignty, representation, equality, and freedom.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"18:05:00"}]}],[]]},
