The primary focus of the course is on practical skill development: identifying relevant scientific literature, reading scientific articles, project planning, and proposal writing. In addition, you will hear from faculty and staff around the university about research methods and the scientific process. The course is designed around writing your own project proposal, with additional skill development exercises. Students are expected to come to this class with a research idea and a research advisor outside of this course. Preference to undergraduates writing applications for summer or honors research grants (e.g., SES, VPUE). Open to other projects and students with instructor permission.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:30:00"}]}],[]]},
