{"10SC":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"10SC","title":"Lives of Consequence","description":"This course examines how exceptionally creative individuals from a variety of domains (including the arts, sciences, politics, technology, and society) found a sense of purpose in their lives and then successfully pursued that purpose. In the creative domain, for example, we examine the lives of filmmaker George Lucas, Apple CEO Steve Jobs, lifestyle designer Martha Stewart, and master chef Thomas Keller. In the political sphere, we examine the lives of Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King, and Robert F. Kennedy. We also explore the work of individuals engaged in philanthropic efforts around the globe, including Melinda Gates and Paul Farmer.  We complement the study of these individuals, and others, with a variety of readings from the social science literature on happiness, meaning, and creativity.  Students interested in psychology, philosophy, creativity, the arts and sciences, or business should find the course particularly useful and engaging. Students, working individually and in small groups, will have a chance to apply the course concepts to their own lives, using a series of reflective writing exercises. Students will complete an independent research project on a topic or person of interest to them.  They will make a presentation to the class on the basis of their research. The course is designed to be highly discussion-oriented and interactive.  Students may take this course for either a letter grade or on a pass/fail basis. Letter grades for the course will be based upon the quality of the independent library research and class presentation, along with the quality and consistency of class participation. Both components (research and class participation) are equally weighted.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":211889,},

In fact, most performing arts groups are organized as nonprofit organizations, because they cannot make enough money to cover costs and survive as profit-seeking businesses. In this seminar we will explore the reasons for the tension between artistic excellence and economic security,drawing on the experience of performing arts organizations in the United States and in countries(whose governments have adopted quite different policies toward the arts). Using economic concepts and analysis that we develop in the seminar, you will first examine the fundamental reasons for the economic challenges faced by performing arts organizations. In later sessions, we will consider and evaluate alternative solutions to these challenges in the United States and other countries. The seminar may include meetings with managers and/or trustees of arts organizations.nnBy the end of the seminar, you will be able to assess the economic condition of an arts organization, evaluate alternative strategies for its survival, and understand the consequences of alternative government policies toward the arts.nnDuring the early part of the course, you will prepare two short papers on topics or questions that I will suggest. Later, you will prepare a longer paper applying concepts learned to one of the performing arts or a particular arts organization that interests you.

The learning format is based on active engagement. For most of the classes, students will be required to lead off the class discussions. The ultimate goal of this course is to make students (and the instructor) smarter about the strengths and limits of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social change. To this end, we will focus on global poverty reduction as a testing ground. During this process we will explore different theories, concepts, frameworks, and guidelines for effective social entrepreneurship to see whether, when and how these help. nnnThe course is organized into three modules. The first focuses on how social entrepreneurship fits in a broader framework of social change and social innovation. The second module provides a brief overview of issues, debates, and theories about poverty and development.

Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments.nnnGSB314 combines a seminar/discussion format (Tuesdays) with a team-based project (Thursdays). For the Tuesday sessions, students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions.  Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions.  A framework based on the recently published World Economic Forum (WEF) report on \"Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics\" will be used to structure the course.  Each student will prepare a short paper on a topic of interest from this portion of the course.nnnThe Thursday sessions is a team-based exercise for students who either have a specific idea or want to join a team of classmates to pursue more deeply an understanding of the team's country of focus and an initial investigation of the idea's viability.  In order to enroll in GSB314, students will be required to submit a short description of their idea and identify classmates interested in joining their team.  Priority will be given to students who have taken STRAMGT 547 - Identifying Opportunities in Developing Economies, and identified an idea from that course.  Students must come in willing to be team players and do the work necessary to complete this exercise over the full quarter. Each team member's contributions will be assessed by fellow teammates.  Teams will be formed before the start of class or on the first day at the latest. The team will describe, in a final presentation, the challenges and opportunities in their country using the WEF framework.  The final presentation will also include the team's thoughts on the viability of their proposed venture and how it capitalizes on their country's assets and addresses its challenges.

It&Atilde;&cent;??s not your reputation at a given moment that is significant; rather, it is the Continuum of Reputation throughout your career that matters.nnnThe course is designed along three interlocking elements: reputation management literature, relevant case studies, and curated guest speakers. Beginning with the frameworks of Paul Argenti, one of the leaders in the field of reputation management, students will learn the fundamentals of strategic corporate communication and the risk of not managing reputation effectively. These frameworks will be extended with specific case studies to illustrate where individuals, groups, and firms have faced the challenge of managing reputation effectively. We will focus on both traditional and virtual components of communication including the relevancy of online reputation management. Finally we will invite key leaders who have built their careers in media through effective communication. We have already begun discussions to ensure availability and have initial commitments from a wide range of on-camera talent, off-camera producers and network executives, a renowned author, a hollywood director and corporate spokespeople and strategists.

(3) Students who are interested in acquiring a private firm either directly (search funds, minority investments, etc) or indirectly (private equity, etc). (4) Students who seek to consult or provide professional services to closely held firms or their owners (wealth management solutions, management consulting, etc). The main objectives of this course are three. First, to understand the challenges and characteristics of family firms. Second, to provide a coherent and consistent set of tools to evaluate the most relevant decisions faced by family firms. Third, to focus on decision-making. The course uses a combination of case studies, guest speakers, lectures, and student presentations to explore the central ideas of the course.nn","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":207182,},
"336":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"336","title":"Energy Markets and Policy","description":"Transforming the global energy system to reduce climate change impacts, ensure security of supply, and foster economic development of the world's poorest regions depends on the ability of commercial players to deliver the needed energy at scale. Technological innovation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for this to occur. The complex institutional frameworks that regulate energy markets in the United States and around the world will play a major role in determining the financial viability of firms in the energy sector. In this course we survey the institutional contexts for energy enterprises of all types and consider what kinds of business models work in each setting. We study in detail how markets function for carbon (assessing the advantages and disadvantages of different policy tools and considering in particular California's implementation of A.B. 32); electricity (with extensive discussion of wholesale electricity markets, energy trading, and issues of market power); renewable energy technologies (focusing on ways to manage intermittency and on how renewable energy businesses respond to government incentives); nuclear power (as a case study of how the regulatory process affects investment decisions); oil and natural gas (treating both conventional and unconventional resources and emphasizing the key role of risk management in an industry characterized by uncertainty and high capital requirements); transportation fuels (discussing biofuels incentives, fuel efficiency standards, and other policy tools to lower carbon intensity); and energy for low-income populations, for which affordability and distribution pose special challenges. A primary teaching tool in the course is a game-based simulation of California's electricity markets under cap and trade. Student teams play the role of power companies and compete to maximize return by bidding generation into electricity markets and trading carbon allowances. The objective of the course is to provide a robust intellectual framework for analyzing how a business can most constructively participate in any sector like energy that is heavily affected by government policy.

"359":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"359","title":"Leading Your Life","description":"This course takes conventional managerial perspectives on the \"strategic leadership\" of organizations and applies them to the design and management of your life. Fundamental notions of \"purpose\" and \"vision\" are translated to the personal level in the form of \"dreams\" and \"aspirations.\" Basic elements of strategy such as \"scope\" and \"competitive advantage\" are applied to help you evaluate fundamental choices about how you lead your life. Constructs such as \"priorities,\" \"commitments\" and \"resource allocation\" all have analogues in individual life - as does the core objective of performance and success. The class begins with a hard-nosed and broad-based self-assessment of the quality of your life along a variety of dimensions including relationships, career, money, spirituality and health. Based on this assessment you will develop a strategy and a set of concrete goals for enhancing the quality of your life in targeted domains. The course consists of five intensive sessions designed to help you develop the skills and knowledge- but more importantly the insight and capacity - to be more strategic (in best sense of the term) and effective in how you lead your personal and professional life - meaning actively guiding, stewarding, and driving your results to create a life that is truly exceptional. Substantively, the course draws on a variety of different traditions including existential, humanistic, and positive psychology; personal growth, adult development, and the human potential movement; as well as the practice of life and executive coaching. Central themes and learning objectives include: * The development of self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-control * An understanding of the power of choice and \"authoring\" one's life * The essential role of dreams and aspirations * The art and discipline of knowing and speaking your truth * The challenges and self-limiting impact of negative thoughts and self-theories * Developing a stance towards oneself and others that is rooted in grace and wisdom NB: While we expect the class to be helpful and of interest to a wide range of students, it involves a substantial commitment of time and emotional and intellectual energy. It is not for the faint of heart or those who are ambivalent about introspection, feedback, or constructive confrontation.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212725,},

We'll look beyond partisan battle lines and explore various fiscal philosophies that sometimes split the political parties. We'll cover the federal budget process from developing the President's budget to enacting individual spending and tax bills, and discuss process reforms including spending and deficit reduction targets, a balanced budget amendment, and line item veto. We'll cover the major players in the budget debate and understand where the big and small budget decisions are made. We'll look at federal taxation, where the money comes from, how it affects the economy, and how it might be restructured. We'll examine the recommendations of the President's budget commission and see if we can predict what will become of its recommendations.
