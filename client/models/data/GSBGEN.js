Through the years, many individuals have led the struggle for gay rights and inclusion through a variety of different communication strategies and tactics; some were successful while others were not. This seminar course will explore some of the key leaders in the LGBT community and how they chose to communicate. Together we will search through a variety of film clips, transcripts, news reports, and other historical elements to see how the message, media, and moments work together. A number of guest speakers will also share their perspective on what it means to \"Lead Out Loud.\" Heterosexual identified students as well as LGBT students are encouraged to apply; in fact, we seek to have a true diversity of opinions in the room as we explore this topic. All students will benefit from this exploration of how to communicate about controversial, sensitive, and personal subjects with greater strength and purpose.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["EC-Gender"],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,true],"start":"13:30:00","end":"15:00:00"}]}]]},

"340":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"340","title":"Financial Crises in the U.S. and Europe","description":"This lecture course will explore the U.S. financial crisis of 2008 and the European debt crisis of 2011-13.  We will examine the causes of both crises, policies implemented during the crisis, and options for reform.  This is an economic policy course rather than a pure economics course. It will focus on the practical intersection of economics, financial markets and institutions, policy, and politics.  Topics we will examine include the following for the 2008 crisis:  - Did a global savings glut, international savings flows, or Fed policy cause the credit bubble?  - What caused the housing and mortgage bubbles?  - How does a bad mortgage turn into a toxic financial asset?  - Why and how did large financial institutions fail? What's the difference between a solvency crisis and a liquidity crisis?  - What is Too Big To Fail? Is it real? Why was Bear Stearns bailed out but not Lehman?  - Was the global financial system on the verge of meltdown in September 2008? How? Why?  - What was the TARP? The TALF? The CPP? The stress tests?  - What can we learn from comparing the US financial crisis with that in other major economies?  - How effective were various policy tools during the crisis?  - How have policies enacted and implemented since the crisis changed the outlook for the future?  For the European debt crisis we will examine:  - The fiscal and economic situations in various European countries;  - The structures and history of the Eurozone;  - Policy options to address problems in troubled European economies;  - The interaction between European financial institutions and European governments; and  - Options for longer-term reform of the Eurozone.  There will be no exams.  Students will write two individual memos and a group memo.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"08:00:00","end":"09:45:00"}]}],[],[]]},

"363":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"363","title":"Fiscal Policy","description":"More than one out of every five dollars in the American economy will be spent by the federal government this year. This course will examine how federal spending, taxes, deficits and debt affect the U.S. economy and global financial markets, and how the economy affects the federal budget. We will look inside the federal budget to understand entitlement spending, what causes it to grow so fast, how it could be reformed, and why that's so hard to do. We'll understand where the money goes -- how much goes to infrastructure, education, housing, health care, energy and the environment, parks, scientific research, national defense, and other needs. We'll look at the stimulus vs. austerity debate, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and Europe. We'll look beyond partisan battle lines and explore various fiscal philosophies that sometimes split the political parties. We'll cover the federal budget process from developing the President's budget to enacting individual spending and tax bills, and discuss process reforms including spending and deficit reduction targets, a balanced budget amendment, and line item veto. We'll cover the major players in the budget debate and understand where the big and small budget decisions are made. We'll look at federal taxation, where the money comes from, how it affects the economy, and how it might be restructured.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"08:00:00","end":"09:45:00"}]}],[]]}}
