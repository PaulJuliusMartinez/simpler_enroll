{"113N":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"113N","title":"The Economic Survival of the Performing Arts","description":"Even the most artistically accomplished and well-managed performing arts organizations--symphony orchestras, operas, dance companies, and many theaters--tend to live on the edge financially. In fact, most performing arts groups are organized as nonprofit organizations, because they cannot make enough money to cover costs and survive as profit-seeking businesses. In this seminar we will explore the reasons for the tension between artistic excellence and economic security,drawing on the experience of performing arts organizations in the United States and in countries(whose governments have adopted quite different policies toward the arts). Using economic concepts and analysis that we develop in the seminar, you will first examine the fundamental reasons for the economic challenges faced by performing arts organizations. In later sessions, we will consider and evaluate alternative solutions to these challenges in the United States and other countries. The seminar may include meetings with managers and/or trustees of arts organizations.nnnBy the end of the seminar, you will be able to assess the economic condition of an arts organization, evaluate alternative strategies for its survival, and understand the consequences of alternative government policies toward the arts.nnnDuring the early part of the course, you will prepare two short papers on topics or questions that I will suggest. Later, you will prepare a longer paper applying concepts learned to one of the performing arts or a particular arts organization that interests you. You will submit that paper in stages, as you learn about concepts and issues that are relevant to your analysis. There will also be a final exam.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"id":215636,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Flanagan, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":["Flanagan, R."],"location":""}],"id":30410}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
"340":{"department":"GSBGEN","number":"340","title":"Financial Crises in the U.S. and Europe","description":"This lecture course will explore the U.S.-centered financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing European financial crisis.nnWe will examine the causes of both crises, policies implemented during the crisis, and options for reform.nnThis is an economic policy course rather than a pure economics course. It will focus on the practical intersection of economics, financial markets and institutions, policy, and politics.nnTopics we will examine include the following for the 2008 crisis:n- Did a global savings glut, international savings flows, or Fed policy cause the credit bubble?n- What caused the housing and mortgage bubbles?n- How does a bad mortgage turn into a toxic financial asset?n- Why and how did large financial institutions fail? What's the difference between a solvency crisis and a liquidity crisis?n- What is Too Big To Fail? Is it real? Why was Bear Stearns bailed out but not Lehman?n- Was the global financial system on the verge of meltdown in September 2008? How? Why?n- What was the TARP? The TALF? The CPP? The stress tests?n- What can we learn from comparing the US financial crisis with that in other major economies?n- How effective were various policy tools during the crisis?n- How have policies enacted and implemented since the crisis changed the outlook for the future?nnFor the European debt crisis we will examine:n- The fiscal and economic situations in various European countries;n- The structures and history of the Eurozone;n- Policy options to address problems in troubled European economies;n- The interaction between European financial institutions and European governments; andn- Options for longer-term reform of the Eurozone.n nThere will be no exams.  Students will write two individual memos and a group memo.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":212221,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Hennessey, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"8:00:00 AM","end":"9:45:00 AM","instructors":["Hennessey, K."],"location":""}],"id":27472}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

In this seminar, students will decide how and to which nonprofit organization they will make a real $100,000 donation. The students, guided by the instructor, will choose what readings and resources to draw on in making their decisions from a bibliography provided as well as other sources they develop. They will also  discover, debate, discuss and decide what evaluation approach approach to use as well as what decision-making process to apply. Students are likely to be asked to research and present  knowledge on relevant topics. And a final presentation to a donor trying to decide whether to fund part of the $100,000 is likely also.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215823,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Meehan, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Meehan, B."],"location":""}],"id":27460}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
