This year's topic is \"Introducing Ockham & His Razor: Mind & Metaphysics, Logic, Epistemology, & Ethics.\" Course runs June 2-4, 2016. Guest lectures by Peter King (Toronto), Elizabeth Karger (CNRS, Paris).nWe begin with a general introduction to Ockham's place in the history of philosophy from Democritus to Descartes.Then we turn to Ockham's logic and his most popular work, the Summa logicae. In this connection we will discuss Ockham's distinction between absolute and connotative terms and his theory of supposition, a theory that corresponds roughly to modern reference theory. nOn day two we take up Ockham's  Epistemology, the distinction he drew between intuitive & abstractive cognition, his approach to problems of certainty and judgment, and his response to skeptical worries.  In this connection we will discuss the razor in its application of sensible species.  nnThat  afternoon our topic will be nominalist metaphysics & the razor as Ockham deploys the principle of parsimony to justify his denial of common natures and his rejection of some of the Aristotelian categories, such as motion and relation. More generally we see an approach to physics with minimal reliance on metaphysics.nnDay three begins with philosophy of mind.  Here we will see Ockham refusing to posit faculties of will and intellect distinct from the intellective soul itself, while admitting a distinction between the sensitive and intellective souls. The course will close with a discussion of Ockham's ethics and politics.  In ethics we will consider the ground of the good and the connection of the virtues; in politics we will focus on property rights, a major source of controversy within the church.","min_units":1,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":217891,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Wood, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"4:00:00 PM","instructors":["Wood, R."],"location":"90-92Q"}],"id":57877}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Chances are, this artist has thousands, if not millions, of adoring fans. That is, what's \"bad music\" to you is \"good music\" to others. This fact is not shocking: we all know that people have different tastes in music, and in art more generally. But what does this fact tell us about art, other people, and ourselves? Are some of us right and others of us wrong about what's good and bad music? Is there reason to think that some music is \"objectively\" better than other music? Can we say that those who like \"bad music\" are missing something, or mistaken in their tastes? If so, why not think it's us that are mistaken? How much are our own tastes bound up with \"who we are\"? And what might this mean for our capacity to appreciate tastes which are not our own?nThis seminar is an investigation into these and other questions. Through the specific lens of music, we will explore the nature of artistic taste more generally. Our main course text will be Carl Wilson's Let's Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste, a popular introduction to our topic. We will also look at and discuss actual album reviews, pieces of music journalism, and news stories. Class meetings will be heavily discussion-based, and students should come to class ready to share, debate, and scrutinize their own musical tastes. Outside of class, students will develop their understanding through a variety of informal and creative writing assignments, such as exploratory journal entries and mock fan letters. Your taste in music may very well change as a result of this seminar, but this is not its aim. The goal is to understand what it means to disagree about art, through which you will learn how to respond more intelligently and empathetically to such disagreements as they come up in your everyday life.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"id":216984,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Costello, W."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Costello, W."],"location":"70-72A1"}],"id":29936}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

When we cause greenhouse gas to be emitted for our own benefit, the gas spreads around the world and does harm everywhere. Many of those who are harmed emit very little greenhouse gas themselves. When some people harm others for their own benefit, something is morally wrong. Specifically, there is an injustice. One of the ethical problems raised by climate change is how to rectify this injustice. Climate change also raises a different range of ethical questions, which may be classified as questions of value. For example, in making decisions, how should the distant future be valued in comparison with the present and how should we take account of the great loss of human life that climate change will cause? This course investigates the issues of justice and the issues of value. It considers the moral demands that climate change puts both on private individuals and on public institutions. Because the effects of climate change are so widespread and so complex, the methods of economics can be useful in putting ethical principles into effect. The course will therefore assess some of these methods.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":217214,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Broome, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Broome, J.","Francis, B."],"location":"School of Education 206"}],"id":46217}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Francis, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Francis, B."],"location":"80-115"}],"id":58276}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

This year's topic is \"Introducing Ockham & His Razor: Mind & Metaphysics, Logic, Epistemology, & Ethics.\" Course runs June 2-4, 2016. Guest lectures by Peter King (Toronto), Elizabeth Karger (CNRS, Paris).nWe begin with a general introduction to Ockham's place in the history of philosophy from Democritus to Descartes.Then we turn to Ockham's logic and his most popular work, the Summa logicae. In this connection we will discuss Ockham's distinction between absolute and connotative terms and his theory of supposition, a theory that corresponds roughly to modern reference theory. nOn day two we take up Ockham's  Epistemology, the distinction he drew between intuitive & abstractive cognition, his approach to problems of certainty and judgment, and his response to skeptical worries.  In this connection we will discuss the razor in its application of sensible species.  nnThat  afternoon our topic will be nominalist metaphysics & the razor as Ockham deploys the principle of parsimony to justify his denial of common natures and his rejection of some of the Aristotelian categories, such as motion and relation. More generally we see an approach to physics with minimal reliance on metaphysics.nnDay three begins with philosophy of mind.  Here we will see Ockham refusing to posit faculties of will and intellect distinct from the intellective soul itself, while admitting a distinction between the sensitive and intellective souls. The course will close with a discussion of Ockham's ethics and politics.  In ethics we will consider the ground of the good and the connection of the virtues; in politics we will focus on property rights, a major source of controversy within the church.","min_units":1,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":217891,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Wood, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"4:00:00 PM","instructors":["Wood, R."],"location":"90-92Q"}],"id":57878}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

When we cause greenhouse gas to be emitted for our own benefit, the gas spreads around the world and does harm everywhere. Many of those who are harmed emit very little greenhouse gas themselves. When some people harm others for their own benefit, something is morally wrong. Specifically, there is an injustice. One of the ethical problems raised by climate change is how to rectify this injustice. Climate change also raises a different range of ethical questions, which may be classified as questions of value. For example, in making decisions, how should the distant future be valued in comparison with the present and how should we take account of the great loss of human life that climate change will cause? This course investigates the issues of justice and the issues of value. It considers the moral demands that climate change puts both on private individuals and on public institutions. Because the effects of climate change are so widespread and so complex, the methods of economics can be useful in putting ethical principles into effect. The course will therefore assess some of these methods.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":217214,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Francis, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Broome, J.","Francis, B."],"location":"School of Education 206"}],"id":46218}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Neuroimaging technology seems to be closing in on `thought identification&iquest;, i.e. determining an individual&iquest;s thought content merely by scanning the brain. Do we have a right to keep our thoughts private or is it permissible to use imaging technologies, perhaps in judicial settings, to identify someone&iquest;s thoughts? What happens to our concepts of moral responsibility when a brain scan reveals abnormalities in the brain? Do these findings have bearing on our understanding of free will? Commonplace drugs can prevent the forming of memories of painful events. Should we take these drugs to shield ourselves from traumatic memories or is it good for us to remember unpleasant events in order to learn and grow from them?
