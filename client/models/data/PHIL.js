And we sometimes think we should do something for the sake of another person, even when it is inconvenient, costly, or unpleasant (e.g. we stop to help a stranded motorist, donate to charity, or tell someone an embarrassing truth rather than a face-saving lie).  When we do the former, we act prudently.  When we do the latter, we act morally.  This course explores the debate among philosophers about the source of our reasons for acting prudently and morally.  Some argue that our reasons to be prudent and moral stem directly from the fact that we are rational ¿ that it is contrary to reason to ignore our own future interests, or the interests of other people.  Others disagree, arguing that the source of these reasons must lie elsewhere.  Course readings will include work by Thomas Nagel, Bernard Williams, Christine Korsgaard, Derek Parfit, Philippa Foot, and others.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214757,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:45:00 AM","location":"240-201"}],"id":56772}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Such a distinction seems central to how we think about what it is to justify our actions (whether to ourselves or to one another), as well as to our practice of holding one another morally responsible for what we do.  Yet under pressure, this distinction can appear to collapse ¿ we find that we cannot successfully disentangle what a person controls from what she does not when she acts.  This course examines this problem in depth, and considers how we might respond in the face of it:  Is it really a problem?  If so, does it threaten our moral practices?

We shall discuss various notions of betrayal: Political (military) betrayal such as treason, Religious betrayal with Judas as its emblem, but also apostasy (converting one's religion) which is regarded both as a basic human right and also as an act of betrayal, social betrayal - betraying class solidarity as well as Ideological betrayal - betraying a cause. On top of political betrayal we shall deal with personal betrayal, especially in the form of infidelity and in the form of financial betrayal of the kind performed by Madoff. The contrasting notions to betrayal, especially loyalty and trust, will get special consideration so as to shed light or cast shadow, as the case may be, on the idea of betrayal. The seminar will focus not only on the normative aspect of betrayal - moral or legal, but also on the psychological motivations for betraying others.

The view according to which the expression of religious convictions and arguments must have a place in the political sphere is dominant in political philosophy. By contrast, the \"laicist\" view, which is common in Mexico and in France, holds that such an expression must be absent from the institutions of the State as well as from political discourse. This course examines the reasons that motivate the differences between these two views, such as the assumption of a strong religious pluralism in the former and the presupposition of a dominant church and religion in the latter. nn\tThe course is organized in four parts. In the first part we will consider two kinds of political secularization following the well known characterization by Charles Taylor: the \"common ground' and the \"independent ethic\" approaches. We will see how these two approaches result in the two views on the relation between religion and politics mentioned above. In the second part, we will study John Rawls's influential view on the place of religious argument in legal and judicial reasoning in his theory of \"public reason.\" We will contrast this view with Jürgen Habermas's defense of a wide role for religious argument in the public sphere. We will devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the third part, we will turn to the laicist view in the work of both French and Mexican scholars. We will focus on the reasons that motivate a laicist State (Estado laico) and examine whether they still hold. We will examine how the growth of religious pluralism in societies formerly dominated by one single church and religion has forced revisions in the understanding of laicism. We will also devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will consider the implications of these two views on the relation between religion and politics for public schooling, religious freedom, and the separation of Church and State.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214829,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"School of Education 207"}],"id":57181}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

The view according to which the expression of religious convictions and arguments must have a place in the political sphere is dominant in political philosophy. By contrast, the \"laicist\" view, which is common in Mexico and in France, holds that such an expression must be absent from the institutions of the State as well as from political discourse. This course examines the reasons that motivate the differences between these two views, such as the assumption of a strong religious pluralism in the former and the presupposition of a dominant church and religion in the latter. nn\tThe course is organized in four parts. In the first part we will consider two kinds of political secularization following the well known characterization by Charles Taylor: the \"common ground' and the \"independent ethic\" approaches. We will see how these two approaches result in the two views on the relation between religion and politics mentioned above. In the second part, we will study John Rawls's influential view on the place of religious argument in legal and judicial reasoning in his theory of \"public reason.\" We will contrast this view with Jürgen Habermas's defense of a wide role for religious argument in the public sphere. We will devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the third part, we will turn to the laicist view in the work of both French and Mexican scholars. We will focus on the reasons that motivate a laicist State (Estado laico) and examine whether they still hold. We will examine how the growth of religious pluralism in societies formerly dominated by one single church and religion has forced revisions in the understanding of laicism. We will also devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will consider the implications of these two views on the relation between religion and politics for public schooling, religious freedom, and the separation of Church and State.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214829,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"School of Education 207"}],"id":57182}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Close connection between propositional truth and proof is established by the resolution method forming a basis of most automated theorem provers. The language of predicate logic covers much more and illustrates the notion of completeness.

This course will convince you that philosophy actually is useful outside of the classroom--and can have a real impact on your everyday decisions and how to live your life. We'll grapple with tough practical questions such as: 'Is it selfish if I choose to have biological children instead of adopting kids who need homes?'  'Am I behaving badly if I don't wear a helmet when I ride my bike?' 'Should I major in a subject that will help me make a lot of money so I can then donate most of it to overseas aid instead of choosing a major that will make me happy?' Throughout the course, we will discuss philosophical questions about blame, impartiality, the force of different 'shoulds,' and whether there are such things as universal moral rules that apply to everyone.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-ER"],"id":212263,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"160-317"}],"id":57562}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
