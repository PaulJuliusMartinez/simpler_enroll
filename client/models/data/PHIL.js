Getting clear on those moral questions, and the competing answers to them, can help improve both economic analysis and our understanding of the values involved in alternative social policies.  This course focuses on a central economic institution: the market.  How have the benefits and costs of using markets been understood?  For example, it is often claimed that markets are good for welfare, but how is welfare to be understood?  What is the connection between markets and different values such as equality and autonomy?  What, if anything is wrong with markets in everything? Are there moral considerations that allow us to, distinguish different markets? This course examines competing answers to these questions, drawing on historical and contemporary literature.

"73":{"department":"PHIL","number":"73","title":"Collective Action: Ethics and Policy (ETHICSOC 180M, POLISCI 131A, PUBLPOL 304A)","description":"When acting on one's own, it is often relatively easy to know what the morally right action is. But many moral problems arise from the fact that many individuals act together. This can lead to various dilemmas, in which what is individually rational is collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet. At the same time, the decisions of a single individual seem to have no tangible effect on climate change.  Such collective action situations give rise to a number of moral questions. Are individuals required to take their contributions  to wider systemic effects into account, even if they are negligibly small? For example, is it permissible to emit C02 on a Sunday afternoon road trip? Does it make a difference whether or not others are doing their fair share, for example with regard to fighting global poverty? In many cases, the best solution for collective action problems are institutions. But when these are deficient or non-existing, what should individuals do? Do they have a duty to assist in building institutions, and what would this duty imply in practical terms? We will approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, reading authors from philosophy, politics, economics and sociology such as Elinor Ostrom, Peter Singer or Liam Murphy, which we will relate to current questions such as the fight against global poverty and climate change. No background will be assumed and no mathematical work will be required.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["EC-EthicReas","WAY-ER"],"id":213265,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:45:00 PM","location":""}],"id":19006}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
