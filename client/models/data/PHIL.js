In what sense are obligations different from norms? Jorgensen's dilemma, from preference based modal logic to the modern approach. How to reason about dilemmas, contrary-to-duty and defeasible norms? Distinguishing various kinds of defeasibility. How to relate various kinds of permissive and constitutive norms? Permissions as exceptions and prioritized norms. How do norms relate to other modalities like beliefs, desires, and intentions How do norms change? What is the role of time, action and games in deontic reasoning? For each problem, we discuss traditional as well as new research questions. We see the new questions as good questions for current research, in the sense that they point to modern theories and applications.

On top of political betrayal we shall deal with personal betrayal, especially in the form of infidelity and in the form of financial betrayal of the kind performed by Madoff. The contrasting notions to betrayal, especially loyalty and trust, will get special consideration so as to shed light or cast shadow, as the case may be, on the idea of betrayal. The seminar will focus not only on the normative aspect of betrayal - moral or legal, but also on the psychological motivations for betraying others.

"23B":{"department":"PHIL","number":"23B","title":"Truth and Paradox","description":"Philosophical investigation of the concept of truth is often divided along two dimensions: investigation of the nature of truth and investigation of the semantics of truth claims. This tutorial will focus on the second kind of concern. One key impetus for a philosophical interest in the semantics and definability of truth is the challenge posed by semantic paradoxes such as the Liar paradox and Curry&iquest;s paradox. Despite each having the initial appearance of a parlor trick, philosophers and logicians have come to appreciate the deep implications of these paradoxes. The main goal of this tutorial is to gain an appreciation of the philosophical issues -&shy; both with respect to formal and natural languages &shy;&iquest; which arise from consideration of the paradoxes. To this end, we will study some of the classic contributions to this area  including Tarski&iquest;s famous result that, in an important sense, the semantic paradoxes render truth indefinable, and Kripke&iquest;s much later attempt to provide a definition of truth in the face of Tarski&iquest;s limitative result. Further topics include the debate between paracomplete and paraconsistent solutions to the semantic paradoxes (notably defended by, respectively, Field and Priest); the relationship between deflationism about truth and the paradoxes; and the notion of &iquest;revenge problems&iquest; (roughly, the claim that any solution to the paradoxes can be used to construct a further paradox).nThe tutorial will avoid excessive technical discussions, but will aim to engender appreciation for some philosophical interesting technical points and will assume a logic background of PHIL150 level.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":213875,},

This tutorial will focus on what sorts of influence the Principia had on the development of mechanics in roughly the first century following its publication. The work of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace will serve as the primary examples of this development. Kuhn's description of paradigms in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions provides a starting point for understanding some of these forms of influence. In particular, this tutorial will try to explore two central areas of influence. The first is Newton's conceptual framework and how it was modified in the further development of mechanics during this period. The second is how projects suggested by residual problems within the Principia shaped ongoing study.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":216160,},

A standard assumption is that thinking is somehow local to the central nervous system; that is, cognition just amounts to brain activity. A wave of recent work in philosophy and cognitive science has questioned this assumption, insisting that the mind cannot be understood outside the context of a living body interacting dynamically with an environment. To put it more dramatically, the mind extends out into the world. We shall read some of the main proponents of this move toward embodied and embedded cognition, and try to assess the extent to which it seriously calls into question more traditional views about how mind, brain, body, and world fit together.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":211717,},

But for these thinkers pessimism represents a sort of intellectual honesty about human nature, and these insights invariably underscore a profound optimism, in spite of their pessimism, with respect to what they view as the more pressing question concerning what humankind can make itself to be.

In this tutorial course we will explore philosophical thought on perfection in three different contexts:  natural teleology, individual ethical life, and utopian and anti-utopian social thought.  Throughout the course, we will ask the following questions:  What is a perfect being?  Why is perfection per se good or desirable?  Do evaluative comparisons presuppose some absolute standard of perfection?  Does it make sense to aim at perfection in ethical and political life?  What are the virtues of imperfection?  What are the hazards of pursuing perfection in the political realm?  Is perfectionism compatible with pluralism about values?  Is perfectionism compatible with government based on popular will?

We respect many different things and we respect them in many different ways: from parents and elders, to public institutions and the law, and other people's dignity, feelings and rights. Many, in fact, claim that all people deserve respect&iquest;some way or another. Public conversations lately have been plagued with calls to respect the environment, life in all of its forms, citizens&iquest; sexual orientation, etc. Additionally, it is also urged that public debates should take place under conditions of mutual respect: that above and beyond our differences and our interests, we should respect each other as persons. nnnIn particular, philosophers working in moral and political theory focus on what respect for persons might mean&iquest;including oneself and possibly other entities. Such a notion is frequently issued inter alia in discussions about justice and legitimacy, equality and exploitation, multiculturalism and pluralism, toleration and recognition. The main concern here centers on the ways in which citizens should respect one another in plural democracies. Explore whether or not the assumption that in order to properly respect each other as free and equal citizens we are obligated to satisfy certain requirements of justification (viz., public reason) by seeking appropriate political justifications and sometimes exercising restraint in appealing to individual points of views (viz., comprehensive doctrines) in political discourse.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":212305,},

"23R":{"department":"PHIL","number":"23R","title":"What's in an essay?","description":"This course is about two questions:The first question: what is an essay? In other words, what is it that we mean when we talk about an essay instead of a pr&eacute;cis, a paper, a report, a chronicle, a scientific paper, an opinion piece, fiction or simply other kinds of academic writing. Call this first question, the demarcation question about the essay. Essays are particularly hard to pin down, to demarcate its boundaries is almost impossible. The essay represents a distinct challenge for both theory and criticism. Unlike other literary and academic genres, at least since their modern inception in Montaigne&iquest;s hands, essays challenge notions and assumptions that in other genres are transparent or can be more easily set aside.  n  The second question is: what does essaying \"the embarking upon the kind of things essayists claim to be doing\" have to do with the cultivation of one's self, the examination of one's actions and deeds in ordinary contexts and the project of shaping it in self-reflective ways. Call this second question, the Socratic aspiration of the essay. To answer this question, we won&iquest;t start from any pre-establish theory or framework, but rather work our way out directly from the readings of a sample of essays drawn from various sources.  nBy the end of the course, the student will be in a better position to confront questions such as: why are the humanities part and parcel of our educational efforts, more generally, and how could they become part of my education, more particularly? What are the difficulties and advantages, the very point of, writing one's opinions in an attempt to address others? How is self-understanding connected to philosophical endeavors?

Anscombe raises (and answers) questions regarding the nature of intentional action, intention, reasons for action, agential self-knowledge, and practical reasoning, connecting them all in one unified account. nIn the tutorial we will discuss these issues through a close reading of Intention. A short, terse, and marvelously rich self-contained piece of philosophical investigation, it is particularly well-suited for this purpose. Our work with the text should yield a solid basis notably in the philosophy of action, which will be useful for various other courses and areas (in philosophy of action, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language, and ethics).

The issue of quantum entanglement as raised by Einstein and Schr&ouml;dinger in the 1930s and the famous EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paper of 1935. Examination of EPR-type experimental set-ups and a result due to Bell in the 1960s, according to which no \"hidden variables\" theory satisfying a certain locality condition (apparently assumed by EPR) can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. Survey of several live interpretive options for standard quantum mechanics: Bohmian mechanics (a.k.a. 'pilot wave theory'), 'spontaneous collapse'  theories, and Everett&iquest;s relative-state interpretation. Critical scrutiny of the &iquest;decoherence&iquest; program that seeks to explain the classical-to-quantum transition, i.e., the emergence of the world of classical physics and macroscopic objects from quantum physics.

But what does it take to be a good person, in this very general sense? And what about the opposite -- what does it take to be a bad person? We also tend to feel strongly about whether others, or ourselves, are good or bad people. In particular, we blame people for being bad and praise them for being good. But only sometimes -- if someone is bad only because, say, he had a traumatic childhood, then we tend to hold back from blaming him. So, what must be true if someone really is deserving of blame for being bad (or, of praise for being good)? And, finally, there seems to be an important difference between being bad and being completely depraved, or evil. But what underlies this difference? What distinguishes everyday badness from extraordinary evil? This course is dedicated to learning how to look for and evaluate answers to these questions.

"385M":{"department":"PHIL","number":"385M","title":"The Metaphysics of Meaning","description":"One central project in the philosophy of language is to explain the relationships between paradigmatically semantic phenomena like meaning, truth, and reference (as well as entailment, satisfaction, application, and others). Often the pursuit of this project generates orders of explanation in which some notions are privileged as more \"fundamental\" than others, in what is arguably a metaphysical sense of the expression. The dominant order of explanation in both philosophical and linguistic semantics seems to be Referentialism, according to which word/world relationships like reference and application are taken to be more fundamental than sentential truth or meaning. (Think: correspondence theory + model-theoretic semantics.) Alternatives to the orthodoxy include certain versions of conceptual-role semantics, Brandom's inferentialism, and Horwich's use theory of meaning. The aims of this seminar will be to acquaint ourselves with these and other going concerns in the theory of meaning, to organize logical space so that gaps might more easily be spotted, and to help the instructor develop his own, as yet nascent form of opposition to Referentialism. Of special interest will be the alleged normativity of meaning and the Field/Wright dispute over reference to abstracta. Besides the authors already mentioned, readings will be drawn from Katz, King, Kripke, and perhaps (time permitting) Millikan, Peacocke, and/or Taylor as well.

Just what is it for some bits of either our shared public language or our inner thoughts to refer to or stand for bits of the world?  In virtue of what does the relation of reference obtain between some bit of the world and some bit of either outer language or inner thought? What about apparent reference to putatively non-existent objects, like Santa Claus or Sherlock Holmes?  We appear to think and talk about objects that do not exist.  But there are no such objects.  So just how do we manage to think and talk about them?  Or consider abstract objects, like numbers, that are thought by some to exist outside the spatial-temporal order.  We appear to think and talk about such objects as well.  But it is a mystery how, if at all, the reach of our thought could possibly extend beyond even the bounds of space and time.  Though we will  canvass a a number of different answers to this questions, proposed by a variety of philosophers, my main goal will be to  develop and defend a view that I call two-factor referentialism.

Can such cases of indeterminacy be plausibly interpreted as semantic (or epistemic), or do they support the possibility of worldly or \"ontic\" indeterminacy?  Is ontic indeterminacy even coherent?  How might it be modeled?  Parallel questions arise in the metaphysics of ordinary material objects, of course; but it's not obvious that their answers should also run parallel.  And even if they do, focusing on PI lends the questions some real urgency.  How should I feel about the interests of a past or future person who's only indeterminately me?  Should I fear a future in which I merely indeterminately exist?  Maybe outright death is preferable to being literally liminal.  Seminar.

However, the scientific view of human beings as essentially complex, evolutionarily-designed biological systems in a purely material world (one governed by fundamental physical laws) seemingly puts pressure on the idea that humans can live a life of genuine meaningfulness. The guiding questions of this course will be: Is there the prospect of our living truly meaningful lives even if we are just complex biological systems? If so, what kind(s) of meaning can we hope to achieve? If not, how should we live our lives? In exploring these questions, we will read works by philosophers (and psychologists) approaching these questions from many different traditions and perspectives. Possible authors will include Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, Sigmund Freud, Viktor Frankl, Bertrand Russell, John Searle, Owen Flanagan, Daniel Dennett, and Ruth Millikan.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212899,},

They represent these subjects from specific spatial vantage points in ways that may be more or less definite, more or less detailed, and more or less faithful to what the subjects are actually like. One longs to know how this works: how vision, imagination, and background knowledge come together when we experience a picture as a picture. Certain forms of imagining and remembering involve mental picturing, mental imagery. Sometimes we imagine or remember things in visual terms from a specific spatial vantage point, with the result that we feel brought face to face with the things imagined or remembered, however far away they may actually be. How is the physical picturing that goes on in paintings, drawings, and photographs both like and unlike the mental picturing that goes on when things swim before the mind's eye? What role does mental picturing play in physical picturing? What kinds of artistic value and interest attach to paintings, drawings, and photographs in virtue of what they picture and how they picture it?","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["DB-Hum","WAY-A-II"],"id":213484,},

What are our obligations in cases such as the causation of climate change, in which our individual contributions (e.g. our personal greenhouse gas emissions) appear to make no difference to the badness of the outcome? How can we owe obligations to future people who do not yet exist, and what are our obligations to them? Is abortion morally wrong or morally permissible? Could it even be morally required? Can we be obligated to procreate? Or, might procreation be seriously morally problematic? What is racism, and what makes it wrong?

But many moral problems arise from the fact that many individuals act together leading to dilemmas, in which what is individually rational is collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet. But individual decisions seem to have no effect on climate change. Such collective action situations give rise to moral questions: Are individuals required to take their contributions  to wider systemic effects into account? Does it make a difference whether or not others are doing their share, for example with regard to fighting global poverty? In many cases, the best solution for collective action problems are institutions. But when these are deficient or non-existing, what should individuals do? Do they have a duty to assist in building institutions, and what would this duty imply in practical terms?

What are the moral responsibilities of a business owner in a competitive environment? Is it acceptable to employ \"sweatshop labor\"? How do the moral responsibilities of a business owner differ from that of a policy maker? What information does a seller (or buyer) have a moral duty to disclose? In real estate, is a strategic default morally wrong? How much government regulation of Wall Street is morally justified?  We will use the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, J. S.

Close connection between propositional truth and proof is established by the resolution method forming a basis of most automated theorem provers. The language of predicate logic covers much more and illustrates the notion of completeness.
