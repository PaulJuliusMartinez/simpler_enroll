By contrast, the &quot;laicist&quot; view, which is common in Mexico and in France, holds that such an expression must be absent from the institutions of the State as well as from political discourse. This course examines the reasons that motivate the differences between these two views, such as the assumption of a strong religious pluralism in the former and the presupposition of a dominant church and religion in the latter.  	The course is organized in four parts. In the first part we will consider two kinds of political secularization following the well known characterization by Charles Taylor: the &quot;common ground&#39; and the &quot;independent ethic&quot; approaches. We will see how these two approaches result in the two views on the relation between religion and politics mentioned above. In the second part, we will study John Rawls&#39;s influential view on the place of religious argument in legal and judicial reasoning in his theory of &quot;public reason.&quot; We will contrast this view with Jürgen Habermas&#39;s defense of a wide role for religious argument in the public sphere. We will devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the third part, we will turn to the laicist view in the work of both French and Mexican scholars. We will focus on the reasons that motivate a laicist State (Estado laico) and examine whether they still hold. We will examine how the growth of religious pluralism in societies formerly dominated by one single church and religion has forced revisions in the understanding of laicism. We will also devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will consider the implications of these two views on the relation between religion and politics for public schooling, religious freedom, and the separation of Church and State.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]]},

When we do the former, we act prudently.  When we do the latter, we act morally.  This course explores the debate among philosophers about the source of our reasons for acting prudently and morally.  Some argue that our reasons to be prudent and moral stem directly from the fact that we are rational ¿ that it is contrary to reason to ignore our own future interests, or the interests of other people.  Others disagree, arguing that the source of these reasons must lie elsewhere.

The view according to which the expression of religious convictions and arguments must have a place in the political sphere is dominant in political philosophy. By contrast, the &quot;laicist&quot; view, which is common in Mexico and in France, holds that such an expression must be absent from the institutions of the State as well as from political discourse. This course examines the reasons that motivate the differences between these two views, such as the assumption of a strong religious pluralism in the former and the presupposition of a dominant church and religion in the latter.  	The course is organized in four parts. In the first part we will consider two kinds of political secularization following the well known characterization by Charles Taylor: the &quot;common ground&#39; and the &quot;independent ethic&quot; approaches. We will see how these two approaches result in the two views on the relation between religion and politics mentioned above. In the second part, we will study John Rawls&#39;s influential view on the place of religious argument in legal and judicial reasoning in his theory of &quot;public reason.&quot; We will contrast this view with Jürgen Habermas&#39;s defense of a wide role for religious argument in the public sphere. We will devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the third part, we will turn to the laicist view in the work of both French and Mexican scholars. We will focus on the reasons that motivate a laicist State (Estado laico) and examine whether they still hold. We will examine how the growth of religious pluralism in societies formerly dominated by one single church and religion has forced revisions in the understanding of laicism. We will also devote one week for assessing criticisms. In the fourth and final part of the course, we will consider the implications of these two views on the relation between religion and politics for public schooling, religious freedom, and the separation of Church and State.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]]},

Does a preference for the taste of meat justify killing and eating animals? Under what circumstances, if any, is abortion morally permissible? Should employers and schools be allowed to favor minority candidates? Is a ban on trans fat morally impermissible paternalism?

"73":{"department":"PHIL","number":"73","title":"Collective Action: Ethics and Policy (ETHICSOC 180M)","description":"Individually rational actions can give rise to results that are collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet, destroy the world&#39;s fisheries, and increase reliance on factory farming; at the same time, the decisions of a single individual seem to have no tangible effect on such things. In light of this, what (if anything) are you as an individual required to do in these and other collective action situations, especially when others are not doing their part to prevent things from getting out of control? For example, are you required to reduce your carbon footprint and avoid products that are produced in ethically objectionable ways? Do you have a duty to vote? Is free-riding always ethically objectionable? Can you be required to &#39;cooperate&#39; in a situation where you know that most others will &#39;defect&#39;? Finally, from a real-world policy perspective, how can we bring about the best solutions to these and other collective action problems? Is the best policy response always a straightforward function of the variable features of each case? Interdisciplinary readings from authors in philosophy, politics, economics, and law such as Elinor Ostrom, Peter Singer, and Cass Sunstein.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ER"],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"12:30:00"}]}]]},

Do they mean that there are no moral norms in business or do they mean that there are special moral norms in business that differ from those of personal relationships and other spheres of social activity? In this class we will examine ethical questions that arise in the domain of business. We will ask, for example: What does the market reward and what should it reward? What are the moral responsibilities of a business owner in a competitive environment? Is it acceptable to employ &quot;sweatshop labor&quot;? How do the moral responsibilities of a business owner differ from that of a policy maker? What information does a seller (or buyer) have a moral duty to disclose? In real estate, is a strategic default morally wrong? How much government regulation of Wall Street is morally justified?  We will use the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, J. S. Mill, Marx, Jevons and Menger, Hayek, Walzer, and Sandel, among others, to help us answer these questions. We will see, for example, what Aristotle thought about day trading.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["EC-EthicReas","WAY-ER"],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}]]},

"7Q":{"department":"PHIL","number":"7Q","title":"What is Truth","description":"This question can be answered precisely in some important cases. We begin with the language of propositional logic where truth is defined by simple tables. This is already sufficient for description of many important problems and leads to a famous ($1 000 000) problem P=NP. We use Sudoku puzzles for illustration. Close connection between propositional truth and proof is established by the resolution method forming a basis of most automated theorem provers. The language of predicate logic covers much more and illustrates the notion of completeness. Register machines provide connection with computations and lead to a fundamental classification of problems of truth with respect to decidability. The language of arithmetic exhibits a new phenomenon of incompleteness that changed significant part of philosophy in 20-th century.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["DB-Hum"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"12:15:00"}]}],[],[]]},
