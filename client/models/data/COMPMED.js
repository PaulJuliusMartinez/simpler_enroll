"80N":{"department":"COMPMED","number":"80N","title":"Introduction to Animal Behavior","description":"Preference to freshman. Behavior is what makes animals special (thirsty plants don't walk to water), but why do animals behave the way they do? What does their behavior tell us about their inner lives, and about ourselves? What do lipstick and cuckoos and fireflies have in common? Why would nobody want to be a penguin? What do mice say to each other in their pee-mail? Learning how to think about questions like these gives us a unique perspective on the natural world. Format: Discussion and criticism of video examples, documentaries, and research papers. Topics: History and approaches to animal behavior; development of behavior, from genetics to learning; mechanisms of behavior, from neurons to motivation; function of behavior, from honest signals to selfish genes; the phylogeny of behavior, from domestication to speciation; and modern applications of behavior, from abnormal behavior, to conservation, to animal welfare, and animal consciousness.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SMA"],"id":214620,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":26729}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
"87Q":{"department":"COMPMED","number":"87Q","title":"Introduction to the Mouse in Biomedical Research","description":"Preference to sophomores.  Focus is on the laboratory mouse, a widely used and important research model.  Topics include the ethics of animal use in research; the natural history, origin and husbandry of the mouse; characteristics of key mouse strains; its anatomy and physiology; common diseases and their effects on research; coat color genetics relative to human diseases; immunodeficient mouse models; and genetic engineering of mice.  The laboratory includes necropsy, handling, anesthesia, identification methods, and common research techniques using live and dead mice.
