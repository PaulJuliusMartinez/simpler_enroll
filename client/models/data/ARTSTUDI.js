These techniques will be complemented by other ones that can be mixed with etching such as photocopy transfers, Chine coll&eacute; (attaching a different color paper between plate and main paper), and mono-printing. nnEtching/Intaglio (making a mark under the surface of the plate) is one of the most tactile and elegant forms of printmaking. The plate leaves a 3-D line mark and embossed marks in the deep etched areas as well as at the edges of the plate.

What role does sculpture play in a fragile world with depleting natural resources, global economies and media dominance? What is the life cycle of object making and creating? What is our relationship to objects in a growing technological age? Students will make 3-4 projects based on these questions.
