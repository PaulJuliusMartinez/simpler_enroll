"350A":{"department":"ARTSTUDI","number":"350A","title":"Art in Context I : Histories and Design Practices","description":"This two part graduate level course is required for all first year JPD students (both MFA and ME students), and open to all MFA Art Practice students. The first quarter of the course is a seminar, which focuses on the history of design practices and theories in a broad range of fields including design, art, and architecture. We will examine how well known concepts such as \"The Bauhaus\", \"the designer\", \"Design Thinking\", and metaphors such as \"workshop\", \"school\", \"laboratory\", \"studio\", or \"post-studio\" arise, and how they shape the artist or designer's work in a particular cultural context. Through reading, writing, and discussion, students will attempt to define their current position within a historical context and chart their future vision. The course may involve guest lectures and visits to various collections and archives.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213287,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"16:05:00"}],"id":34842}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},

The second quarter of the course is a studio class, which examines our personal relationships to various creative processes (technical, procedural, and conceptual). Our goal is to gain new insights into our creative processes and find new possibilities within our available working methods. We will investigate issues such as constraint, iteration, collaboration, delegation, daily practice, and tools. Assignments such as \"handmade-readymade-fablab\" will challenge students to work with various processes and conceptual frameworks within single projects. The course will include four major projects, many minor studio exercises, readings, and discussion.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213286,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"15:05:00"}],"id":34932}],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},

The first quarter of this course examines artists as contextually engaged problem solvers and provocateurs. What strategies have artists used to draw attention to, and drive change regarding issues they care about? How is art used to change habits, shift the directions of cultural discussions, and make the invisible visible? We will study artists and designers who use innovative techniques to these ends such as Merle Ukeles, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Eduardo Kac, Jon Rubin, Amy Franceschini, Alfredo Jaar, Stamen Design (cab spotting), and Rebar. In addition to readings and discussions, students will create and critique a series of four studio projects that engage participants to rethink a specific site or situation.","min_units":2,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":110596,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}],"id":57827}],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"}}
