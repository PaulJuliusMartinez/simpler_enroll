Conceptual and technical considerations will be addressed. Students will learn traditional building techniques as needed (wood shop, metal shop, mold making, found object) as well as anti-object techniques. Existing at the intersection of art, science, technology and ecology, environmental art often functions to inform and/or interpret natural conditions and the processes associated with both \"non-human\" and \"human-made\" constructions. It will also educate us about environmental issues and concerns. This course introduces and provides a context for this area of interdisciplinary exchange and artist production by examining areas commonly known as cradle to cradle design, land art, eco art, environmental art, and art and technology. What role does sculpture play in a fragile world with depleting natural resources, global economies and media dominance? What is the life cycle of object making and creating? What is our relationship to objects in a growing technological age? Students will make 3-4 projects based on these questions. Group discussions, critiques, readings, video presentations, a field trip to a local artist-in-residence program Recology at the San Francisco Dump, visiting artists and visiting faculty from Stanford doing environmental research will augment this class.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II","WAY-CE"],"id":215571,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"Art6"}],"id":20429}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
