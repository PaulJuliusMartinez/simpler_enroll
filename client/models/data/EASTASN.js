It reviews China's halting progress into the international system, sketches the evolution of PRC foreign policy since 1949, and analyzes China's developmental priorities and domestic political context as they figure into Beijing's interactions with the world.

Existing Western theories cannot fully explain Korea's economic and business development, because these theories were established under a different political, economic, and social system.

This course aims to introduce a new framework that presents strategic implications that are more appropriate for Korea; review the fundamental background of Korea's growth in detail and apply this new framework to better explain Korea's success; and evaluate Korea as a case study to provide useful guidelines for other countries.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217029,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Moon, H."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Moon, H."],"location":"Encina West 202"}],"id":28793}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
