Imagine you lived in a country, in which the ruling and unelected elite holds on to power by intimidating its citizens by pervasive secret reporting, sending many of them to prison.  Imagine you lived in a country, in which one ethnic group slaughters the other.  Imagine you lived in a country in which a racial white minority terrorizes and discriminates against a huge majority of black population.  Imagine you lived in a country in which members of one group engage in an \"ethnic cleansing\" of their old neighbors.nNow imagine something else: some big political change comes to each of these societies, and the oppressors lose their power and fall into disgrace. Now the previously oppressed engage in a deliberation what to do with their former oppressors.  For the most part it is not a question of a brutal revenge by the former victims, but a legitimate and democratically authorized process.nWelcome to the questions of transitional justice.  The scenarios mentioned above are real ones: Cambodia, Germany, Rwanda, South Africa, and Bosnia.  All of them happened in the last few decades.nIn this course we will explore different paths these societies chose to come to terms with past injustices. Each path was devised and decided in a complex public and political debate.nWe will discuss these and other cases of specific injustices, and the subsequent means to achieve a new start for the country.  We will reflect on whether its citizens gained a sense of fairness and hope for a better future, and what it means to come to terms with the past.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI", "WAY-ER"],"id":216866,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lutomski, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Lutomski, P."],"location":"Encina West 108"}],"id":45700}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

The Islamic regime in Iran censors all aethetic production in the country. But Iranian dissident artists, from film-makers and fiction writers to composers in a thriving under-ground musical scene, have cleverly found ways to fight these draconian measures. They have developed an impressive body of work that is as sophisticated in style as it is rich in its discourse of democracy and dissent. The purpose of the seminar is to understand the aesthetic tropes of dissent in Iran, and the social and theological roots of rules of censorship. Masterpieces of post-revolutionary film, fiction, and music will be discussed in the context of tumultuous history of dissent in Islamic Iran.","min_units":2,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":211447,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Milani, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Milani, A."],"location":"260-002"}],"id":15226}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
