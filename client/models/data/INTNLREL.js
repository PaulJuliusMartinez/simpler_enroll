The Islamic regime in Iran censors all aethetic production in the country. But Iranian dissident artists, from film-makers and fiction writers to composers in a thriving under-ground musical scene, have cleverly found ways to fight these draconian measures. They have developed an impressive body of work that is as sophisticated in style as it is rich in its discourse of democracy and dissent. The purpose of the seminar is to understand the aesthetic tropes of dissent in Iran, and the social and theological roots of rules of censorship. Masterpieces of post-revolutionary film, fiction, and music will be discussed in the context of tumultuous history of dissent in Islamic Iran.","min_units":2,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":211447,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Milani, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"11:20:00 AM","instructors":["Milani, A."],"location":"260-002"}],"id":15226}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
