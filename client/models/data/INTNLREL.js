They have developed an impressive body of work that is as sophisticated in style as it is rich in its discourse of democracy and dissent. The purpose of the seminar is to understand the aesthetic tropes of dissent in Iran, and the social and theological roots of rules of censorship. Masterpieces of post-revolutionary film, fiction, and music will be discussed in the context of tumultuous history of dissent in Islamic Iran.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":211447,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"1:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"240-201"}],"id":30615}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
