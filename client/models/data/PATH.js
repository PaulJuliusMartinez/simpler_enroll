{"101":{"department":"PATH","number":"101","title":"Cancer Biology (CBIO 101)","description":"Experimental approaches to understanding the origins, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Focus on key experiments and discoveries with emphasis on genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. Topics include carcinogens, tumor virology, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, cancer genomics, cancer epidemiology, and cancer therapies. Discussion sections based on primary research articles that describe key experiments in the field. Satisfies Central Menu Areas 1 or 2 for Bio majors.

Lymphocytes migrate from blood vessels into tissues to participate in immune surveillance and the development of inflammation. The lymphocyte and blood vessel endothelia molecules that control lymphocyte migration, and are implicated in the development of human diseases such as asthma, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis are discussed.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":128003,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Michie, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"9:00:00 PM","instructors":["Michie, S."],"location":""}],"id":29250}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Intro Dial"},
