First lecture of each week focuses on the clinical, epidemiological and behavioral aspects of a selected disease or syndrome.  Second lecture exposes the cell biological, electrophysiological, biochemical and/or molecular biological processes that underlie each disease presented. Instructors maintain some flexibility in the diseases chosen for elucidation, but students can expect those covered to range from the relatively straightforward, for  example Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), to the more complex, for example, Schizophrenia or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
