"9":{"department":"EARTHSYS","number":"9","title":"Preparing for Your Community Based Internship (HUMBIO 9, URBANST 101)","description":"This course is designed to help students make the most of their internship experience by setting learning goals in advance, negotiating clear roles and expectations, and preparing for the professional role required as part of the organization. The goal is to help students avoid common pitfalls of internships. Through readings, discussions, and guest speakers, explore how to prepare for your internship, work with your community partner, and how best to leverage an internship when you return: as a research topic in an honors thesis, as a fellowship placement, or as a stepping stone to future career opportunities. This class is oriented to students who have already identified an internship for summer or a later quarter, but we are open to discussions about finding and funding internships if of interest to students. For HumBio majors, this course counts towards the Foundations requirement.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215363,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"20-22K"}],"id":29193}],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":"Lathrop 299"}],"id":29555}],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":2647}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
