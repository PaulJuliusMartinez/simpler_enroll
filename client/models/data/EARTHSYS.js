This course surveys key aspects of each energy resource, including significance and potential conversion processes and technologies, drivers and barriers, policy and regulatory environment, and social, economic, and environmental impacts. Both depletable and renewable energy resources are covered, including oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, biomass, hydroelectric, wind, solar, photovoltaics, geothermal, and ocean energy, with cross-cutting topics including electricity, storage, climate change, sustainability, green buildings, energy efficiency, transportation, and the developing world. Understanding Energy is part of a trio of inter-related courses aimed at gaining an in-depth understanding of each energy resource - from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The other two classes are CEE107W/207W Understanding Energy - Workshop, and CEE 107F/207F Understanding Energy -- Field Trips.
