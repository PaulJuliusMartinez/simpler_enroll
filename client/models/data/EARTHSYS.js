Mounting evidence however shows that environmental and social change are almost always inextricably linked, and the climate crisis is pushing together these two areas of study like never before. That is good news, but tough questions remain. What happens when the environmental costs of personal freedom can no longer be sustained? Should the needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few? Are we responsible for repairing the injustices of our parents' and grandparents' generations? Where are the win-win solutions? In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will explore the theory and practice of sustainability and social justice, examining case studies where they have intersected, and where they have not.

From introducing oxygen into the Earth&iquest;s atmosphere over 2 billion years ago to consuming greenhouse gases today, microbial communities have had (and continue to have) a significant impact on our planet. In this seminar, students will learn how microbes transformed the ancient Earth environment into our modern planet, how they currently sustain our Earth&iquest;s ecosystems, and how scientists study them both in the present and in the past. Students will be exposed to the fundamentals of microbiology, biogeochemistry, and Earth history.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217294,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Welander, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Welander, P."],"location":"Shriram Ctr BioChemE 368"}],"id":47339}]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

(GS 46Q)","description":"In order to reduce CO2 emissions and meet growing energy demands during the 21st Century, the world can expect to experience major shifts in the types and proportions of energy-producing systems.  These decisions will depend on considerations of cost per energy unit, resource availability, and unique national policy needs.  Less often considered is the environmental impact of the different energy producing systems: fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, and other alternatives.  One of the challenges has been not only to evaluate the environmental impact but also to develop a systematic basis for comparison of environmental impact among the energy sources.  The course will consider fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum and coal), nuclear power, wind and solar and consider the impact of resource extraction, refining and production, transmission and utilization for each energy source.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215471,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ewing, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ewing, R.","Turner, K."],"location":"Green Earth Sciences134"}],"id":27120}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
