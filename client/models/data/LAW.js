A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal court litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements, in response to which the federal courts have developed. Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create &quot;legislative courts&quot; outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers. The course is strongly recommended for students interested in pursuing a career in litigation and/or judicial clerkships in the federal courts. Elements used in grading:  Class attendance, class participation, take home exam and short paper.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[""],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"09:00:00","end":"11:00:00"}]}],[]]},
"283":{"department":"LAW","number":"283","title":"Federal Courts","description":"This course considers the role of the federal courts in the federal system. It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.  This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship. This course complements Constitutional Litigation (Law 641), and students, especially those who plan to clerk, will benefit from taking both courses.  Exam:  In-School: Three hour exam. Students may consult course materials and their own notes, but not treatises, including Chemerinsky, commercial outlines, or student notes from past years or other schools.  Elements use in grading:  Class participation, attendance and final exam.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[""],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,true,true,true,false],"start":"11:15:00","end":"12:30:00"}]}],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,true,true,true,false],"start":"11:15:00","end":"12:30:00"}]}]]},
"290":{"department":"LAW","number":"290","title":"Evidence","description":"Evidence rules constrain proof at criminal and civil trials.  We will study the Federal Rules of Evidence, related case law, and those constitutional concepts that limit proof at criminal trials.  Topics include relevance, unfair prejudice, character evidence, impeachment, the rape shield law, hearsay, and the Confrontation and Compulsory Process Clauses. Please note that the California Bar Examiners have posted this announcement: Applicants should be prepared to answer questions that have issues concerning the Federal Rules of Evidence and the California Evidence Code. Applicants should be prepared to compare and contrast the differences between the Federal Rules and the California Evidence Code, especially where the California rules of evidence have no specific counterparts in the Federal Rules. This evidence course covers only the Federal Rules of Evidence and does not address the California Evidence Code.  Although similar principles of law govern the California Code and Federal Rules, the two sets of rules are not identical. Students preparing for the California Bar Exam will have to learn some new material. In-School Exam: one-half essay and one-half multiple choice. This course is open to first-year Law School students.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[""],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"19:15:00"},{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:05:00","end":"16:05:00"}]}],[]]},
"299":{"department":"LAW","number":"299","title":"Derivatives","description":"The course will examine the legal, regulatory, trading and risk management aspects of the $600 trillion notional over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives markets. Derivatives are not well-understood by regulators or the public, and have been blamed for causing or contributing to the economic crisis. This course will offer students the opportunity to understand how various derivative products are designed, traded and risk-managed and what role regulators play in the derivatives industry. In addition, students will focus on understanding key legal contracts that underpin the global derivatives industry, in particular focusing on the ISDA© Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex, as well as documentation supporting credit derivatives. Students will also consider the shifting regulatory landscape for financial institutions and hedge funds as it relates to the way in which these products are traded, with rates and credit products migrating to clearinghouses, as well as how conduct of business rules and disclosures may shift. The course will conclude with an examination of the economic crisis that erupted with Lehman Brothers&#39; bankruptcy in September 2008 and the consequent policy reactions to that event from a derivatives and bankruptcy perspective.
