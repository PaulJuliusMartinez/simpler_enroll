"278":{"department":"LAW","number":"278","title":"The Article III Judge","description":"The contemporary debate over the proper role of a federal judge under the Constitution turns, in large measure, on what it is we think an Article III judge is doing when she is called upon to resolve a \"case or controversy.\" Is she looking for the fair result?  If so, by whose lights?  Is she a political actor, or is she instead looking for a rule of decision that has been previously established by law (a \"mere translator\" of the law, in Justice Frankfurter's words).  If so, by natural law or positive law? These are some of the questions we will consider in discussing what role a federal judge plays when she exercises \"the judicial Power of the United States\" conferred by Article III of the Constitution. Readings will include books and articles by some of the leading legal thinkers in the nation's history.  nSpecial Instructions:  This class will meet the first three weeks of the quarter only.nElements used in grading:  Class attendance and participation, reading the assigned material, and four short papers (no longer than 3 pages each) reacting to the readings.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":214896,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,true,true,false,false],"start":"11:10:00","end":"13:10:00","location":""}],"id":57358}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
"283":{"department":"LAW","number":"283","title":"Federal Courts","description":"This course addresses the role of the federal courts in the American system of federalism and separation of powers, as well as their role in the development of substantive federal law and constitutional rights. A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal court litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements, in response to which the federal courts have developed. Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create \"legislative courts\" outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.

It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.nnThis course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship.

Students will also consider the shifting regulatory landscape for financial institutions and hedge funds as it relates to the way in which these products are traded, with rates and credit products migrating to clearinghouses, as well as how conduct of business rules and disclosures may shift.

Topics will include overviews of the history and sociology of the profession; the role of lawyers as advocates in the adversary system, as counselors and as gatekeepers; obligations to clients, courts, adversaries, and third parties; obligations of competence, loyalty, and confidentiality; and modes of regulation.nThe course is in part designed to satisfy the American Bar Association's requirement that every law student have some instruction in professional responsibility and legal ethics. The course provides an introduction to and an overview of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. (Most of the states - California is the major exception - base their ethics codes largely on the Model Rules, with modifications varying from state to state.) But the course also reflects the view that it is of limited use to learn the ethics rules in the abstract. Lawyers in different practice contexts face very different pressures and incentives to engage in unethical conduct; and develop very different norms and customs about how to interpret the rules. In any case, as we'll see, the Rules are wholly inadequate guides to practice.  They are silent or vague on many of the important dilemmas lawyers face and they are only one of many sources of law governing lawyers.nThe \"legal profession\" is really many different sub-professions, segmented by education, practice institutions (e.g. large firms v. small and solo practices), practice specialties, and types of represented parties (e.g. plaintiffs or defendants, individuals or corporate entities, governments or private parties). Much of this course is given to descriptions and analyses of some of these various practices and of the organizations and incentives that structure lawyers' work. So, for example, we will be looking at large law firms representing and counseling corporate clients; plaintiff's lawyers representing individuals in personal-injury tort or mass-tort class-action litigation; prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers; and \"public interest\" lawyers.nCourse requirements may be satisfied in one of two ways:  (1) A take-home examination given at the end of the course; or (2) A research paper on a topic within the scope of the course, based in significant part on primary source materials.

It begins with a review of a corporate acquisition agreement, the document at the center of a friendly transaction. We then consider a variety of explanations for how corporate acquisitions may promise to create value, and think about why they often fail to meet that expectation. In doing so, we will review the basics of accounting for acquisitions and their tax treatment.
