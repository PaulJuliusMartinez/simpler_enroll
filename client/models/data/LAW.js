And it will critically examine efforts to promote rule of law in countries at a state-building stage of development. The seminar will situate rule of law programs conceptually and practically around the core challenge of the state-building enterprise: to build durable formal and informal institutions, including legal institutions, which have legitimacy and capacity and can ensure security. The seminar also will critically assess case studies as well as project documents generated by the development industry on state-building. The theoretical and applied discussions will lay the foundation for the third part of the seminar, a practicum unit where students will present draft project proposals, project work products or analytical papers. In the practicum unit, one group will build on the on-going Afghanistan Legal Education Project, another will pursue needs in the Bhutan Law and Policy Project, and another group will focus on needs in the Timor Leste Legal Education Project. Yet another group of students will develop rule of law projects for other countries within the scope of the seminar or write analytical problem oriented papers about the challenges to building the rule of law in one or more of these countries. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this seminar is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; and least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan. &lt;br&gt;  Special Instructions: Students have the option to receive Writing (W) credit or Research (R) credit upon instructor approval.

In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.

The course will consider the history of the criminal jury trial, legal and strategic considerations in jury selection, jurors¿ ability to act as fact-finders, rules protecting jury deliberations, the consequences of juror misconduct, and the practical importance of plea bargains as an alternative to jury trials.  Students will observe portions of actual jury trials occurring at the Palo Alto Superior Court courthouse.  They will also examine legal decisions, theoretical critiques, and empirical research about the jury.  Class discussion will consider the practical challenges for lawyers and judges posed by jury trials.  The course will culminate in a discussion of potential reforms to the jury system, with each student proposing a reform based on his or her in-person observations and review of the relevant literature.

"335":{"department":"LAW","number":"335","title":"Legal Ethics","description":"This course is a survey overview of the American legal profession, some of its leading institutions and fields of practice, and the ethical, legal, and administrative regimes that govern the practice of law.  Topics will include overviews of the history and sociology of the profession; the role of lawyers as advocates in the adversary system, as counselors and as gatekeepers; obligations to clients, courts, adversaries, and third parties; obligations of competence, loyalty, and confidentiality; and modes of regulation. The course is in part designed to satisfy the American Bar Association's requirement that every law student have some instruction in professional responsibility and legal ethics. The course provides an introduction to and an overview of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. (Most of the states - California is the major exception - base their ethics codes largely on the Model Rules, with modifications varying from state to state.) But the course also reflects the view that it is of limited use to learn the ethics rules in the abstract. Lawyers in different practice contexts face very different pressures and incentives to engage in unethical conduct; and develop very different norms and customs about how to interpret the rules. In any case, as we'll see, the Rules are wholly inadequate guides to practice.  They are silent or vague on many of the important dilemmas lawyers face and they are only one of many sources of law governing lawyers. The \"legal profession\" is really many different sub-professions, segmented by education, practice institutions (e.g. large firms v. small and solo practices), practice specialties, and types of represented parties (e.g. plaintiffs or defendants, individuals or corporate entities, governments or private parties). Much of this course is given to descriptions and analyses of some of these various practices and of the organizations and incentives that structure lawyers' work. So, for example, we will be looking at large law firms representing and counseling corporate clients; plaintiff's lawyers representing individuals in personal-injury tort or mass-tort class-action litigation; prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers; and \"public interest\" lawyers. Course requirements may be satisfied in one of two ways:  (1) A take-home examination given at the end of the course; or (2) A research paper on a topic within the scope of the course, based in significant part on primary source materials.

The seminar also will explore the full range of environmental issues associated with major infrastructure development, including an in-depth discussion and evaluation of permitting reforms and environmental issues that the Administration is now addressing under Executive Order 13604 (President Obama's infrastructure permitting reform initiative).","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"19:15:00"}]}],[],[]]},
"397":{"department":"LAW","number":"397","title":"Law and Economics of Death Penalty","description":"This course will explore three primary issues: 1) the Supreme Court's forty-year effort to define what cases can permissibly receive the death penalty and the procedures under which it must be imposed; 2) the arguments for and against the death penalty, with a major focus on whether the death penalty deters, is administered in a racially biased way, or is otherwise implemented in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and 3) what the U.S. and international status of the death penalty is today and what the prospects are for the future. The readings on deterrence and racial discrimination will entail some substantial statistical analysis, although a background in statistics, though helpful, will not be required. Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length. Elements used in grading:  Written assignments and final paper. Writing (W) credit is for 3Ls only.","min_units":2,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"18:15:00"}]},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"18:15:00"}]}],[]]}}
