The focus is on monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and other environments where market mechanisms are unlikely to produce outcomes that benefit consumers more than the alternatives involving costly government intervention. The two main areas examined are competition policy and economic regulation. Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provides consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as:  telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours.

Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond \"normal business hours.\" Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.

First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond \"normal business hours.\" Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical credits during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses.  For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.  Elements used in grading: Attendance and participation in class, case and project work and writing assignments.

The course will begin with an exploration of the historical developments that led to antidiscrimination law, and with an introduction to the competing frameworks that define current antidiscrimination law: the discriminatory purpose and anti-classification approaches that feature prominently in equal protection doctrine, and the disparate impact framework that is incorporated into some statutory law. After some exploration of the historical origins of antidiscrimination law and its alternative formulations, the course will then turn to the specific contexts in which controversies arise. The settings that will be examined include criminal justice, college admissions, political participation, primary/secondary education, employment, housing, hate speech, and the formation of family relationships. In each of these settings, we will devote close attention to the role of antidiscrimination law in specific controversies.

The course focuses on certain recurrent themes: How do statutes and courts define (or attempt to define) art-and how is art defined differently for different legal purposes? How does the special character of art justify or require different treatment under the law from that accorded other tangible personal property, and how does (and should) the expressive nature of art affect the way it is owned, protected, regulated, or funded? We anticipate having two or three visitors to the class during the quarter, such as a gallery owner, auctioneer, and museum director. In addition, we will also have the students participate in at least one or two interactive negotiation simulation exercises inspired by real situations and controversies in the art world.

Accordingly, this course is concerned with the constitutional rules and political pressures that shape agencies; how agencies interpret statutes, promulgate regulations, and adjudicate disputes; the major statutes affecting how agencies work, particularly the Administrative Procedure Act; how the leadership of the executive branch tries to control agency actions; how agencies make judgments about the costs and benefits of regulatory policies; and how courts review agency action.  The course will cover these topics through cases and examples drawn from a variety of areas, including, separation of powers, the constitutional law of due process, environmental policy, health and safety, and national security.

Law & Creativity will meet twice a week and have dual components designed to inform one another. The first session will be structured as a seminar in which students gather to examine and discuss creative treatments of legal and professional issues in a variety of media (including film, fiction, and nonfiction). The second session will follow the creative-writing workshop model in which students submit their own fiction and creative nonfiction pieces for group discussion.

Our work focuses on the relationship between law, regulation and innovation in areas ranging from biotechnology to information technology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology, and the creation and distribution of information.  Students will represent a variety of NGOs and non-profit entities and, in certain cases, groups or associations of innovators, entrepreneurs, technology users or consumers, economists, technologists, legal academics, and the like, and occasionally individual inventors, start-ups, journalists, or researchers. Students will address their client's complex issues through tools that may include amicus briefs; comments or testimony in rulemaking and regulatory proceedings (i.e., DMCA exemption requests, comments to OSTP on issues such as open access, privacy or open data, comments to the FTC as part of IP and innovation hearings and reports, comments to the PTO or FDA, etc.); comments or testimony on proposed legislation; and whitepapers or other \"best practices\" documents to encourage sensible and balanced legal approaches to innovation and creativity. Our policy advocacy will often involve intertwined factual, technological, business, economic, political and public relations considerations along with the substantive legal issues. Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate policy advocacy for their clients.  The clinic seminar will focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around innovation, innovation economics and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. We will explore the process of policy advocacy, including various policy levers, the types of tools available to advocates and the strategies and tactics that may be employed, and will consider and critique a variety of case studies of previous advocacy, situating them in the larger context in which these efforts occurred. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes and bring those lessons to bear on their own clinic work.

There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis.  Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours.

Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.  The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work).

Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend approximately five inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four credits. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

In the clinic, students develop legal advice, learn to review and write contracts and governance materials, meet with client executives, examine commercial relationships, and receive extensive feedback about their work. No prior experience in business, finance, or corporate law is necessary.  Students work on structural, programmatic, contractual, affiliation, and governance matters for corporate entities. Students typically represent multiple clients during the term, interact with client CEOs, CFOs, board members, and general counsels, and work in teams with other students and the instructors. Students receive detailed comments about the design, content, and execution of work-products and client communications, and about their performance in client meetings and calls. Students regularly assess their own work throughout the quarter and prepare a self-evaluation at the end of the term.  O&T clients are all established Northern California nonprofit corporations. Most of the clients generate annual revenues in the range of $1 - $25 million, and some are considerably larger. We focus on these organizations because they are corporations that typically have substantial governance and external disclosure obligations, active boards of directors, audited financial statements, complex programs, varied collaborations, and diverse funding sources and contractual relationships -- all of which are relevant to and productive of corporate work -- yet are small enough that the clinic's contact is a senior executive. We think they provide excellent material for students learning about organizational representation and institutional corporate practice.  The course includes a seminar that generally meets twice a week. Seminar meetings focus on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on orientation to corporate practice, including discussion of core commercial relationships such as acquisition, credit, and licensing, and practice skills such as transaction planning and management.  Evaluation and grading are based on detailed points of emphasis that reflect ways of working we believe characterize an effective lawyer and responsible colleague.

"273":{"department":"LAW","number":"273","title":"Deals I","description":"This course applies economic concepts to the practice of structuring contracts.  Our goal is to understand common problems and solutions that arise in complex deals.  The course extends over two quarters, meeting three hours per week the first quarter and two hours per week the second quarter.  Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters.  The first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting, discussing economics articles and case studies of actual contracts that illustrate  the concepts described in the articles.  We focus on the issues arising from transaction costs, adverse selection, moral hazard, problems of enforceability, agency problems, and contracting over time.  During the second quarter, we will explore the connection between economic theory and contracting practice by studying specific deals. Students, divided into groups, will study a deal and give a class presentation based on their deal.  A lawyer or another participant in the deal will also lead a class discussion of that deal.  When it works, the students' and the practitioners' analyses are mutually enlightening.  In the past, we have studied movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, and corporate reorganizations.  This course is capped at 30 Students, 12 GSB, 18 Law School students.  Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. The course is open to first-year Law School students. Writing (W) credit is for 3Ls only.  No exam in Winter Term. An In-School exam will be given at the conclusion of the course in the Spring Term.

Our goal is to understand common problems and solutions that arise in complex deals.  The course extends over two quarters, meeting three hours per week the first quarter and two hours per week the second quarter.  Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters.  The first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting, discussing economics articles and case studies of actual contracts that illustrate  the concepts described in the articles.  We focus on the issues arising from transaction costs, adverse selection, moral hazard, problems of enforceability, agency problems and contracting over time.  During the second quarter, we will explore the connection between economic theory and contracting practice by studying specific deals. Students, divided into groups, will study a deal and give a class presentation based on their deal.  A lawyer or another participant in the deal will also lead a class discussion of that deal.  When it works, the students' and the practitioners' analyses are mutually enlightening.  In the past, we have studied movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, and corporate reorganizations.  This course is capped at 30 Students, 12 GSB, 18 Law School students.  Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. The course is open to first-year Law School students.

A principal focus will be tort liability, and a central theme in the course will be whether tort law is an effective method of compensating victims of toxic exposure and controlling the distribution and/or emission of toxic substances. In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured \"public law\" litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures. In each instance, we will look at the nature of the public health problem as well as ensuing tort litigation and regulatory activity.

Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create \"legislative courts\" outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.

It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.  This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship.

This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the \"final cut\" and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like.

We'll consider how general counsel today play an important role on the executive team of major companies and explore the different ways in which general counsels manage large corporate legal departments and direct functional legal areas like litigation, IP, corporate and securities, M&A, environmental and employment law. We will also examine the professional responsibilities and legal obligations of the general counsel -- including the delicate and sometimes conflicting reporting relationships to the CEO and the board of directors -- and consider how an in-house legal department fits into a corporation's organizational structure and how it supports the company's operating units on a day-to-day basis. We will explore the general counsel's role in internal investigations, regulatory investigations and compliance programs, and governmental affairs.

The qualities are sometimes defined in terms of judgment or practical wisdom; the skills in terms of problem solving and decision making.  La Rochefoucauld wrote that \"everyone complains about his memory; no one complains about his judgment.\"  While people's judgments may not have improved during the intervening three centuries, economics and statistics have developed an array of formal tools to aid in decision making, social scientists have a deeper understanding of the psychological phenomena that compromise judgments, and the past decades have seen the evolution of systems analysis, design thinking, and other promising heuristics for problem solving.  After introducing frameworks and tools for problem solving and decision making, we examine the extensive research on the heuristics and biases that produce errors in making inferences and choices, with the hope that understanding these errors can at least sometimes help avoid them. We also survey the emerging literature in behavioral economics that suggests ways that policy makers can counter the effects of biases to induce people to act in their own or society's interests in areas ranging from personal health decisions to global warming.

Since the establishment by the Security Council of the United Nations established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia twenty years ago, the field has experienced remarkable growth. The international community has created a range of new international criminal tribunals to investigate and prosecute international crimes. National courts are now also exercising an expanded domestic and universal criminal jurisdiction over international or transnational crimes. The substantive criminal law has also expanded, and notions of individual responsibility for international crimes have evolved and extend the reach of international criminal law.  At the same time, new debates have emerged about the suitability of using criminal justice mechanisms to respond to mass atrocity situations. nnThis course will explore legal and institutional responses to transnational and international crime.  It will examine traditional forms of international cooperation to address transnational crimes and the concept of universal jurisdiction that provides a basis for treating certain crimes as \"international.\"  It will cover the range of institutions created to punish international criminals, including the Nuremburg and Tokyo tribunals, the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the \"mixed\" international/domestic tribunals such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Cambodia war crimes tribunal, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. As these tribunals approach the end of their mandates, the International Criminal Court is assuming greater importance.

Employment-related lawsuits filed in federal court have tripled in volume in the past decade, and now account for a tenth of all civil cases. Many state courts have experienced a similar burgeoning of their employment law caseloads. This course examines this diverse, rewarding, and rapidly evolving area of legal practice by considering the diverse array of laws and institutions that regulate the employment relationship. The focus of the course is on laws that affect employees in non-unionized settings, such as protections against dismissal without cause, wage and hour restrictions, workplace privacy, covenants not to compete, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and mandatory arbitration of employment disputes. The course does not cover either Employment Discrimination or Labor Law, both of which are offered as separate courses. Special Instructions:  Regular, punctual attendance is required.

For example, in most countries public corporations have a controlling shareholder. In this seminar we'll examine the organization of enterprise in a range of both developed and developing countries to the end of understanding their variety, including the influence of a country's political governance. As part of this exercise, we'll look at the ways in which organizations and organizational law have evolved in different countries, and we'll speculate on the directions in which they'll continue to evolve in the future.

"343":{"department":"LAW","number":"343","title":"Intellectual Property: Scientific Evidence in Patent Litigation","description":"(Same as GENE 243). This seminar will explore the role of scientific experts in patent infringement litigation.  The class will have a mix of law students and doctoral candidates from the sciences and engineering.  The law students must have some familiarity with United States patent law from classes or work experience.  The graduate students must have completed their required coursework and have TGR status. In other areas of the law where scientific experts are used -- medical malpractice, environmental law, criminal law -- the science itself is often in dispute.  In patent cases, however, the parties generally agree on the science. This affects the relationship between the lawyer and the expert and the substantive content of their interactions. Patent experts need to be able to explain science to the judge and jury, of course.  But they also must help the litigators to choose which legal issues to press and which to concede, and to be aware of how the complications of the science might help, hurt, obscure or reveal how the law should be applied to the facts.  Thus, both the lawyer and the scientist must educate the other about their specialties.nnFor the first several weeks, the class will examine judicial decisions and trial documents involving scientific evidence in patent litigation.  The rest of the quarter is largely devoted to work on the final projects: simulations of expert testimony in a patent case.  Students will work together in teams an will meet regularly with the instructor in order to: select suitable patents; identify a balanced issue on either validity or infringement; prepare claim charts and materials for testimony; and give short, illustrated talks to inform their classmates about their projects.  Finally, they will choose sides (patent owner or accused infringer) and finetune their presentations. The simulations will be performed at the end of the quarter before panels of practicing patent lawyers.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":209608,},

Topics include cybercrimes (spam, fraud, cyberbullying), privacy, and First Amendment issues (defamation, threats, and indecent speech).  The perspective will be from that of a practitioner faced with various fact patterns and known case law who has to advise his/her client on the best course of action.

"388":{"department":"LAW","number":"388","title":"Technological, Economic and Business Forces Transforming the Private Practice of Law","description":"The private commercial practice of law is undergoing fundamental change.  Modern technological, economic and business forces are placing extreme pressure on the traditional private attorney law firm model.  These forces will transform, eliminate or replace virtually every aspect of legal services provided by attorneys.  Traditional foundations of the large law firm model such as \"billable\" hours, summer associate programs, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries) and high associate-to-partner ratios are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era.  Today, the business need for clients to select a one-stop, full-service law firm for their important legal work has, in a variety of circumstances, disappeared.  Sophisticated clients are utilizing a wide range of legal services firms and companies for their legal work.  As a result, the diversity of legal business models and manner of providing legal services has greatly expanded.  Often individual lawyers (or very small firms) can provide high-level legal services by assembling \"virtual\" teams in which each team member handles a different constituent part of the representation.  \"In-sourcing,\" \"out-sourcing\" and the transferring of large portions of work to non-lawyer legal support vendors are all becoming fixtures of the legal economy.  This rapid increase in diversity on both the supply and demand side of the legal economy will greatly alter the skills and prerequisites required for the successful private practice of law.  The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to private practice law firms will be examined.  In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment.  Part two of the course will additionally focus on how specific skills such as project management, social networking and information management will be crucial to a successful legal career.  Part two of the course will also discuss how the changing legal environment creates new ethical and professional challenges for attorneys.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation and written assignments.  Writing (W) credit is for students entering prior to Autumn 2012.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":212620,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30313}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"393":{"department":"LAW","number":"393","title":"Remedies","description":"The remedy is arguably the most important part of any lawsuit, and often the most neglected. This course considers the question of what plaintiffs are entitled to when they win a case and why.  It will cover damages, punitive damages, restitution, unjust enrichment, and injunctive relief.  While we will consider public remedies in constitutional cases, the majority of the course will focus on remedies in private law civil actions.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":211572,},

"395":{"department":"LAW","number":"395","title":"Creating New Legal Tools to Address the Environmental Impacts of Energy Projects","description":"A domestic energy boom is underway with major new energy projects being sited on both private and public lands, including wind projects, utility-scale solar projects, oil and gas projects, and associated transmission lines and pipeline projects.  Many of these projects have significant footprints, with related negative impacts on their local environments. Students will work with policymakers in Sacramento and Washington this fall in evaluating new regulatory and market-based options to address the environmental impacts of energy-related projects.  In doing so, seminar participants will be working \"in real time\" on new state and federal initiatives to develop more expedited and effective mechanisms to compensate for environmental impacts of energy and other infrastructure projects, including a number of large renewable energy projects that currently are being developed on public and private lands in the southwest. The seminar also will explore the full range of environmental issues associated with major infrastructure development, including an in-depth discussion and evaluation of permitting reforms and environmental issues that the Administration is now addressing under Executive Order 13604 (President Obama's infrastructure permitting reform initiative).","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":214948,},
"397":{"department":"LAW","number":"397","title":"Law and Economics of Death Penalty Seminar","description":"This seminar will examine the legal and policy aspects of a capital punishment regime.  Students will have the option to take the seminar alone or to combine it with a practicum.  This seminar component  will explore three primary issues: 1) the Supreme Court's forty-year effort to define what cases can permissibly receive the death penalty and the procedures under which it must be imposed; 2) the arguments for and against the death penalty, with a major focus on whether the death penalty deters, is administered in a racially biased way, or is otherwise implemented in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and 3) what the U.S. and international status of the death penalty is today and what the prospects are for the future.  The readings on deterrence and racial discrimination will entail some substantial statistical analysis, although a background in statistics, though helpful, will not be required. Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length.  Writing (W) credit is for students entering prior to Autumn 2012.  Elements used in grading seminar: Written assignments and final paper.  Students who take the practicum component must attend the 9 seminar class meetings and  do all reading and writing assignments of the seminar except that instead of writing a final paper of their choosing they will focus on actual policy or litigation work that will be arranged with various death penalty abolition groups.  I expect that there will be an opportunity to work on policy relevant research that will be of assistance in the repeal movement (as well as attending the 9 seminar class meetings and doing the readings for each class).","min_units":2,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212468,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":29299},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","location":"William H.
