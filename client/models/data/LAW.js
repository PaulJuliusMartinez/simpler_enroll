Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provides consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as:  telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

Accordingly, this course is concerned with the constitutional rules and political pressures that shape agencies; how agencies interpret statutes, promulgate regulations, and adjudicate disputes; the major statutes affecting how agencies work, particularly the Administrative Procedure Act; how the leadership of the executive branch tries to control agency actions; how agencies make judgments about the costs and benefits of regulatory policies; and how courts review agency action.  The course will cover these topics through cases and examples drawn from a variety of areas, including, separation of powers, the constitutional law of due process, environmental policy, health and safety, and national security.

The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course expounds on the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, and seminar discussions -- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process.  Students will explore these issues in a weekly 3-hour seminar and then discuss application to their particular Rule of Law Project countries in weekly hourlong workshops. This course will employ case studies as a way to analyze rule-of-law practice within development theory. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; and least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan.

If so, by natural law or positive law? These are some of the questions we will consider in discussing what role a federal judge plays when she exercises \"the judicial Power of the United States\" conferred by Article III of the Constitution.

A principal focus will be tort liability, and a central theme in the course will be whether tort law is an effective method of compensating victims of toxic exposure and controlling the distribution and/or emission of toxic substances. In order to assess the efficacy of tort, it is essential to compare the liability system with alternatives such as restructured \"public law\" litigation, administrative compensation schemes, and regulatory control strategies. Moreover, it seems equally important that these options be grounded in a concrete understanding of the major current problem areas.  To accomplish these aims, the course will focus on a number of specific present concerns, including tobacco, asbestos, anti-inflammatory drugs, and workplace emissions exposures. In each instance, we will look at the nature of the public health problem as well as ensuing tort litigation and regulatory activity.

Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create \"legislative courts\" outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.

It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.  This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship. This course complements Constitutional Litigation (Law 641), and students, especially those who plan to clerk, will benefit from taking both courses.  In-School: Three hour exam.

This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the \"final cut\" and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like. We plan to include guest speakers from the entertainment industry so that this class will embody both business and legal considerations.  The overall goals of this course are (1) to expose students to the unique and increasingly complex structure of the entertainment business; (2) to foster an understanding of the role the law and entertainment lawyers play in that unique business structure; (3) to strengthen students' ability to draft key documents and craft persuasive legal arguments to accomplish the goals they may seek to achieve as lawyers in the entertainment industry; and (4) to develop the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to make them into effective entertainment lawyers.

They will also examine legal decisions, theoretical critiques, and empirical research about the jury. Class discussion will consider the practical challenges for lawyers and judges posed by jury trials. The course will culminate in a discussion of potential reforms to the jury system, with each student proposing a reform based on his or her in-person observations and review of the relevant literature.

The qualities are sometimes defined in terms of judgment or practical wisdom; the skills in terms of problem solving and decision making.  La Rochefoucauld wrote that \"everyone complains about his memory; no one complains about his judgment.\"  While people's judgments may not have improved during the intervening three centuries, economics and statistics have developed an array of formal tools to aid in decision making, social scientists have a deeper understanding of the psychological phenomena that compromise judgments, and the past decades have seen the evolution of systems analysis, design thinking, and other promising heuristics for problem solving.  After introducing frameworks and tools for problem solving and decision making, we examine the extensive research on the heuristics and biases that produce errors in making inferences and choices, with the hope that understanding these errors can at least sometimes help avoid them. We also survey the emerging literature in behavioral economics that suggests ways that policy makers can counter the effects of biases to induce people to act in their own or society's interests in areas ranging from personal health decisions to global warming.

"372":{"department":"LAW","number":"372","title":"Legal History Workshop","description":"The Legal History Workshop is designed as a forum in which faculty and students from both the Law School and the History Department can discuss some of the best work now being done in the field of legal history. Every other week, an invited speaker will present his or her current research for discussion. This year the theme of the Workshop will be Conservative Legal Movements from 1950 to the Present. Speakers will include Reva Siegel, the Nicholas deB. Katzenbach Professor of Law at Yale Law School, and Thomas Sugrue, the David Boies Professor of History and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, as well several other scholars of law, the social sciences and humanities writing about this topic. In the week prior to a given speaker's presentation, the class will meet as a group to discuss secondary literature relevant to understanding and critiquing the speaker's research. Students will then read the speaker's paper in advance of the following week's workshop presentation.  Special Instructions: Students are required to write a brief response to each speaker's paper. There will be a total of four speakers, and thus four papers. Guidance will be provided concerning how to frame these response papers, which will be due every two weeks - i.e., on the day before speaker presents and students will receive \"W\" writing credit. Students taking the course to receive \"R\" research credit are required to write a research paper on a legal history topic that they choose (in consultation with the professor). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length.

"381":{"department":"LAW","number":"381","title":"Wrongful Convictions: Causes, Preventions and Remedies","description":"Over the course of the past two decades there has been increasing recognition that, despite its commitment to the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, our criminal justice system yields a steady stream of wrongful convictions.  This Seminar will focus on some causes, preventions and potential remedies for this phenomenon. Subjects to be addressed include eyewitness identification, interrogations and confessions, jailhouse informant testimony, forensic evidence, the psychology of tunnel vision and confirmation bias, the role of appellate review and habeas corpus, the role of clemency, the impact of the problem on the death penalty, and issues around compensation of those who have been wrongly convicted.  The class will meet for two hours each week. In addition, there will be three additional evening or weekend sessions (to be scheduled at the convenience of the participants). During each of these additional sessions, students will watch a film involving a wrongful conviction and will engage in conversation about the particular case involved.  Each student will be responsible for preparing a paper on an appropriate topic to be chosen in consultation with the instructor.

"388":{"department":"LAW","number":"388","title":"Technological, Economic and Business Forces Transforming the Private Practice of Law","description":"The private commercial practice of law is undergoing fundamental change.  Modern technological, economic and business forces are placing extreme pressure on the traditional private attorney law firm model.  These forces will transform, eliminate or replace virtually every aspect of legal services provided by attorneys.  Traditional foundations of the large law firm model such as \"billable\" hours, summer associate programs, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries) and high associate-to-partner ratios are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era.  Today, the business need for clients to select a one-stop, full-service law firm for their important legal work has, in a variety of circumstances, disappeared.  Sophisticated clients are utilizing a wide range of legal services firms and companies for their legal work.  As a result, the diversity of legal business models and manner of providing legal services has greatly expanded.  Often individual lawyers (or very small firms) can provide high-level legal services by assembling \"virtual\" teams in which each team member handles a different constituent part of the representation.  \"In-sourcing,\" \"out-sourcing\" and the transferring of large portions of work to non-lawyer legal support vendors are all becoming fixtures of the legal economy.  This rapid increase in diversity on both the supply and demand side of the legal economy will greatly alter the skills and prerequisites required for the successful private practice of law.  The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to private practice law firms will be examined.  In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment.  Part two of the course will additionally focus on how specific skills such as project management, social networking and information management will be crucial to a successful legal career.  Part two of the course will also discuss how the changing legal environment creates new ethical and professional challenges for attorneys.

"397":{"department":"LAW","number":"397","title":"Law and Economics of Death Penalty Seminar","description":"This seminar will examine the legal and policy aspects of a capital punishment regime.  Students will have the option to take the seminar alone or to combine it with a practicum.  This seminar component  will explore three primary issues: 1) the Supreme Court's forty-year effort to define what cases can permissibly receive the death penalty and the procedures under which it must be imposed; 2) the arguments for and against the death penalty, with a major focus on whether the death penalty deters, is administered in a racially biased way, or is otherwise implemented in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and 3) what the U.S. and international status of the death penalty is today and what the prospects are for the future.  The readings on deterrence and racial discrimination will entail some substantial statistical analysis, although a background in statistics, though helpful, will not be required. Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on the paper length.  Writing (W) credit is for students entering prior to Autumn 2012.  Elements used in grading seminar: Written assignments and final paper.  Students who take the practicum component must attend the 9 seminar class meetings and  do all reading and writing assignments of the seminar except that instead of writing a final paper of their choosing they will focus on actual policy or litigation work that will be arranged with various death penalty abolition groups.  I expect that there will be an opportunity to work on policy relevant research that will be of assistance in the repeal movement (as well as attending the 9 seminar class meetings and doing the readings for each class).","min_units":2,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212468,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":29299},{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"6:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":29298}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
