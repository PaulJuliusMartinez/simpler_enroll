Essentially, in a given context, what is the relationship of law to political, social, and economic change?  This course will employ case studies as a way to analyze rule-of-law practice within development theory. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Hungary.  Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper (for R credit) or an in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research.

Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create \"legislative courts\" outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), doctrine will be placed alongside interdisciplinary readings on social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers.

It is both an advanced course in constitutional law and a course on the institutional design of the federal courts. In the first aspect, we consider two great themes: the allocation of power between the states and the federal government -- federalism -- and the relationship between the federal courts and the political branches of the national government -- separation of powers. In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism. This course is highly recommended for students planning to practice in the federal courts, and many judges consider it essential preparation for a judicial clerkship.

Instead, the practice of entertainment law lies at the intersection of various traditional legal disciplines, such as contract, tort, copyright, trademark, antitrust, secured transactions, etc., and applies those disciplines to a unique business setting. This course is intended to approach the study of entertainment law from a practical perspective, applying the principles of traditional legal disciplines to avoid problems and find solutions in various facets of the entertainment industry. To accomplish the necessary background, we will study the entertainment industry from both a macro level (i.e., the organization of the motion picture, television and music business, including the function of studios, producers, networks, record companies, agencies, managers, lawyers and labor unions) and a micro level (i.e., examining actual agreements in order to understand the principal components of motion picture talent, production and distribution contracts, television series contracts, music and book publishing contracts). We will also examine key litigation issues that affect the industry, such as the interaction of the First Amendment and the right of publicity, the right of privacy and libel, the anti-SLAPP laws, the \"final cut\" and profit participation cases. The impact of the digital media (including the internet) will, of course, be analyzed, along with the future of the entertainment industry, including convergence, holograms, syntho-thespians and the like.

In addition, students will focus on understanding key legal contracts that underpin the global derivatives industry, in particular focusing on the ISDA&copy; Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex, as well as documentation supporting credit derivatives and other common derivative types.

Representative of these sessions have been discussions of compensation for government regulations and takings, liability rules for controlling accidents, the definition of markets in antitrust analysis, the role of the government as a controlling shareholder, and optimal drug patent length.  Special Instructions:  You may write a series of short commentaries on the guest speakers' papers, of which there will be four.  Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single research paper on a law and economics topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors/Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis. (You may write a single longer paper for two quarters if you enroll in the Seminar in the Autumn as well.) Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit, depending on the paper length. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this seminar, though students doing the longer research papers typically have some prior training in economics. Students may take both Law and Economics Seminar I and Law and Economics Seminar II in either order (neither is a prerequisite for the other).

As a result, it does not touch on the taxation of partnerships or S corporations, which are the tax-preferred forms for many privately-held business enterprises and investment funds.  The course reviews the tax considerations relevant to each stage in the life cycle of a corporation, but emphasizes business acquisitions and divestitures. The instructor makes special efforts to relate classroom topics to current public deals, to show how tax law develops through complex interactions among Congress, administrative agencies, courts and taxpayers, and to demonstrate how lawyers (in this case, tax lawyers) add value for their clients in structuring transactions. Class participation is expected, but except in extraordinary cases will not be graded. Basic Tax or permission of the instructor is a prerequisite.

It begins with a review of a corporate acquisition agreement, the document at the center of a friendly transaction. We then consider a variety of explanations for how corporate acquisitions may promise to create value, and think about why they often fail to meet that expectation. In doing so, we will review the basics of accounting for acquisitions and their tax treatment. From there we move on to the corporate law side of acquisitions - the different forms the transaction can take, the rules governing hostile transactions, freezeouts of minority shareholders, and proxy fights.

"381":{"department":"LAW","number":"381","title":"Wrongful Convictions: Causes, Preventions and Remedies","description":"Over the course of the past two decades there has been increasing recognition that, despite its commitment to the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, our criminal justice system yields a steady stream of wrongful convictions. This Seminar will focus on some causes, preventions and potential remedies for this phenomenon. Subjects to be addressed include eyewitness identification, interrogations and confessions, jailhouse informant testimony, forensic evidence, the psychology of tunnel vision and confirmation bias, the role of appellate review and habeas corpus, the role of clemency, the impact of the problem on the death penalty, and issues around compensation of those who have been wrongly convicted. As we study these subjects, we will also reflect on whether taking some reforms too far will impair on the efficacy of legitimate law enforcement. The class will meet for two hours each week. In addition, there will be three additional evening or weekend sessions (to be scheduled at the convenience of the participants). During each of these additional sessions, students will watch a film involving a wrongful conviction and will engage in conversation about the particular case involved.

"388":{"department":"LAW","number":"388","title":"Technological, Economic and Business Forces Transforming the Private Practice of Law","description":"The private commercial practice of law is undergoing fundamental change.  Modern technological, economic and business forces are placing extreme pressure on the traditional private attorney law firm model.  These forces will transform, eliminate or replace virtually every aspect of legal services provided by attorneys.  Traditional foundations of the large law firm model such as \"billable\" hours, summer associate programs, large staffs (e.g., paralegals and secretaries) and high associate-to-partner ratios are becoming (or have already become) relics of a bygone era.  Today, the business need for clients to select a one-stop, full-service law firm for their important legal work has, in a variety of circumstances, disappeared.  Sophisticated clients are utilizing a wide range of legal services firms and companies for their legal work.  As a result, the diversity of legal business models and manner of providing legal services has greatly expanded.  Often individual lawyers (or very small firms) can provide high-level legal services by assembling \"virtual\" teams in which each team member handles a different constituent part of the representation.  \"In-sourcing,\" \"out-sourcing\" and the transferring of large portions of work to non-lawyer legal support vendors are all becoming fixtures of the legal economy.  This rapid increase in diversity on both the supply and demand side of the legal economy will greatly alter the skills and prerequisites required for the successful private practice of law.  The course is composed of two parts. In part one, the technological, economic and business practices transforming the legal profession are identified and their impact on the traditional approaches to private practice law firms will be examined.  In part two, the course focuses on how individual lawyers can adapt to or embrace the forces transforming law to improve their practice and succeed in the new environment.  Part two of the course will additionally focus on how specific skills such as project management, social networking and information management will be crucial to a successful legal career.  Part two of the course will also discuss how the changing legal environment creates new ethical and professional challenges for attorneys.

We will survey the dominant legal doctrines for providing redress, the relationship between legal rights and traditional legal remedies, as well as the unique, sometimes paradoxical, features of remedies for constitutional violations - especially in the area of civil rights.  The seminar will also survey the rich non-legal and interdisciplinary discourses on theories of redress and repair including scholarship on reparations, restorative justice, and rectification.  In order to develop a comparative base for assessing the capacity of law to reach and repair complex group-based harms, special attention will be given to cultural practices that have emerged to supplement, substitute for, and sometimes subvert legal remedies.
