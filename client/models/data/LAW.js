Essentially, in a given context, what is the relationship of law to political, social, and economic change?  This course will employ case studies as a way to analyze rule-of-law practice within development theory. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, Georgia, Hungary.

During those five weeks, it will meet on Monday and Friday.  Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during the Fall quarter.  Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of the first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting, reading and discussing the economics underlying business transactions and applying those concepts to focused case studies that illustrate the economic concepts that we study. During the second quarter, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. When it works, the students' and the practitioners' analyses are mutually enlightening. We study five new deals each year. Deals that we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, and corporate reorganizations.

In the other aspect, we focus on the structure of the judicial system, the scope and limits of federal judicial power, essential aspects of federal court procedure, and the evolving structural response of the federal courts to changes in technology, commerce, government, and a multitude of factors that affect the business of the federal courts and the role of federal judges. Topics will include the original and appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, Supreme Court review of state court judgments, federal common law including implied rights of action, Congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create adjudicative bodies within the federal government but outside the requirements of Article III, state sovereign immunity, justiciability, abstention and other doctrines of restraint, and the role of the federal courts in the war on terrorism.

"339":{"department":"LAW","number":"339","title":"Employment Law","description":"Workplace issues have become one of the fastest-growing areas of state and federal law. Employment-related lawsuits filed in federal court have tripled in volume in the past decade, and now account for a tenth of all civil cases. Many state courts have experienced a similar burgeoning of their employment law caseloads. This course examines this diverse, rewarding, and rapidly evolving area of legal practice by considering the diverse array of laws and institutions that regulate the employment relationship.  The substantive focus of the course is on laws that affect employees in non-unionized settings, such as protections against dismissal without cause, wage and hour restrictions, workplace privacy, covenants not to compete, and mandatory arbitration of employment disputes. The course does not cover either Employment Discrimination or Labor Law, both of which are offered as separate courses. The pedagogic approach is to ask students to work through problems, on your own and in small groups in class, where you have to generate and evaluate options to counsel clients on workplace-law issues.  Special Instructions: Early Add/Drop Deadline: Add/Drop decisions must be made the first week of class. Exceptions are at the instructor's discretion and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. No laptops in class, except when designated by instructor.  Elements used in grading: Class participation (30%), two 5-7 page (single-spaced) memos involving research, one due mid-quarter and one due at the end of the quarter (35% each). No final.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":209649,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Solomon, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"8:50:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","instructors":["Solomon, J."],"location":""}],"id":27452}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"344":{"department":"LAW","number":"344","title":"Law and Economics Seminar I","description":"This seminar will examine current research by lawyers and economists on a variety of topics in law and economics. Several sessions of the seminar will consist of an invited speaker, usually from another university, who will discuss his or her current research. Representative of these sessions have been discussions of compensation for government regulations and takings, liability rules for controlling accidents, the definition of markets in antitrust analysis, the role of the government as a controlling shareholder, and optimal drug patent length.  Special Instructions:  You may write a series of short commentaries on the guest speakers' papers, of which there will be four.  Students electing this option will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis and receive 2 units of credit. Alternatively, you may write a single research paper on a law and economics topic of your choice. This will satisfy the Law School's Research requirement. These papers will be graded on an Honors/Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis. (You may write a single longer paper for two quarters if you enroll in the Seminar in the Winter as well.) Students taking the seminar for R credit can take the seminar for either 2 or 3 units of credit, depending on the paper length. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  There is no formal economics prerequisite to take this seminar, though students doing the longer research papers typically have some prior training in economics. Students may take both Law and Economics Seminar I and Law and Economics Seminar II in either order (neither is a prerequisite for the other).  This seminar is cross-listed with the Economics Department (same as Econ 354).  Elements used in grading: Four commentaries or one research paper.

"345":{"department":"LAW","number":"345","title":"Law and Culture in American Fiction","description":"This seminar examines the way literary texts register changes in property law, the law of contracts, intellectual property and legal constructions of race, gender, and privacy, especially as they relate to the maintenance of personal identity, community stability, and linguistic meaning. The terms and stakes of these relationships will inform our readings of the texts themselves, as well as our understanding of their representations of law. The writers whose work we will consider include James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Willa Cather, William Faulkner, and Sherman Alexie. Each week, a novel or story will be paired with relevant legal and historical readings. We will also consider the points of contact between literary narrative and narrative in law.

"351":{"department":"LAW","number":"351","title":"Corporate Income Taxation","description":"This course is an intensive introduction to the federal income taxation of large American business corporations. As a result, it does not touch on the taxation of partnerships or S corporations, which are the tax-preferred forms for many privately-held business enterprises and investment funds.  The course reviews the tax considerations relevant to each stage in the life cycle of a corporation, but emphasizes business acquisitions and divestitures. The instructor makes special efforts to relate classroom topics to current public deals, to show how tax law develops through complex interactions among Congress, administrative agencies, courts and taxpayers, and to demonstrate how lawyers (in this case, tax lawyers) add value for their clients in structuring transactions. Class participation is expected, but except in extraordinary cases will not be graded. Basic Tax or permission of the instructor is a prerequisite. The student's final grade will be based on a final exam, although class participation in rare cases may improve a student's grade.

"378":{"department":"LAW","number":"378","title":"Banking Law","description":"This course will examine the legal and regulatory system governing financial institutions, with an emphasis on banks. It will do so by exploring the underlying economics of banking, and the ongoing effort to reform financial regulation. Questions addressed will include: Why do we regulate financial institutions? What dangers do we want to avoid? How well does the current regulatory system achieve what we want to achieve? What alternative approaches can be taken? What are the costs and benefits of the current system, and those of the alternatives?

"393":{"department":"LAW","number":"393","title":"Remedies","description":"This is a seminar in the law, history and culture of remedies.  We will survey the dominant legal doctrines for providing redress, the relationship between legal rights and traditional legal remedies, as well as the unique, sometimes paradoxical, features of remedies for constitutional violations - especially in the area of civil rights.  The seminar will also survey the rich non-legal and interdisciplinary discourses on theories of redress and repair including scholarship on reparations, restorative justice, and rectification.  In order to develop a comparative base for assessing the capacity of law to reach and repair complex group-based harms, special attention will be given to cultural practices that have emerged to supplement, substitute for, and sometimes subvert legal remedies.  Special Instructions:  Students may choose to write either a substantial research paper or a series of three short papers for the course.  Students who choose to write a substantial research paper will receive Research (R) credit.
