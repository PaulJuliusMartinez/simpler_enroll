"371":{"department":"ILAC","number":"371","title":"The Ambiguity of the Periphery","description":"Franz Kafka&#39;s concept of &quot;small literature&quot; is still very useful to understand literary productivity in conflict areas in Europe. Catalonia is always seen as a country that has yet to find its place in Spain. Its uniqueness, however, when compared with other &quot;peripheral&quot; areas, especially with the cultures of Central Europe, is not an exception, but part of a general pattern. In literary terms, the margins of Europe are not invisible: from this perspective it is possible to understand the rich literary heritage of this continent. The course aims to compare the Catalan with other European peripheries through paired readings of Catalan and various European texts from different linguistic traditions, such as the German, the Italian, the Greek, the Czech and the Swedish (Bernhard, Lampedusa, Cavafy, Kundera, Enquist). Taught in Spanish; most readings available in English.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]}],[],[]]},

"75N":{"department":"ITALIAN","number":"75N","title":"Narrative Medicine and Near-Death Experiences (FRENCH 75N)","description":"Even if many of us don&#39;t fully believe in an afterlife, we remain fascinated by visions of it. This course focuses on Near-Death Experiences and the stories around them, investigating them from the many perspectives pertinent to the growing field of narrative medicine: medical, neurological, cognitive, psychological, sociological, literary, and filmic. The goal is not to understand whether the stories are veridical but what they do for us, as individuals, and as a culture, and in particular how they seek to reshape the patient-doctor relationship.  Materials will span the 20th century and come into the present.
