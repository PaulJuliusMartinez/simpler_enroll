{"275":{"department":"CBIO","number":"275","title":"Tumor Immunology (IMMUNOL 275)","description":"Tumor Immunology focuses on the mechanisms by which tumors can escape from and subvert the immune system and conversely on the ability of innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors.  Topics include: tumor antigens, tumor immunosurveillance and immunoediting, tumor immunotherapy (including CAR-T and checkpoint antibodies) and cancer vaccines.  Tracks the historical development of our understanding of modulating tumor immune response and discusses their relative significance in the light of current reserach findings.  Prerequisite: for undergraduates, human biology or biology core.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":210368,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Engleman, E."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Engleman, E."],"location":""}],"id":27260}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
