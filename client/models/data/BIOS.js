{"200":{"department":"BIOS","number":"200","title":"Foundations in Experimental Biology","description":"This course is divided into three 3-week cycles and is focused on the broad themes of Evolution, Energy and Information. During each cycle, students work in small teams and will be coached by faculty to develop an original research project and compose a brief written proposal explaining the research. Skills emphasized include: 1) reading for breadth and depth; 2) developing compelling, creative arguments; 3) communicating with the spoken and written word; 4) working in teams. Peer assessment and workshops; substantial face-to-face discussion with faculty drawn from across the Biosciences programs.","min_units":6,"max_units":6,"gers":[],"id":213297,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":26792},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Goodman, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,true],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Straight, A.","Goodman, M.","Stearns, T."],"location":""}],"id":26789}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
