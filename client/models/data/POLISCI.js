This volatility is of relevance for many countries including the US with its invested interests in the region and Israel that exists at the heart of the region, and along with its conflict with the Palestinians is considered to be one of the root causes of this volatility. Moreover, the volatility brings into encounter two kinds of collective goods: democracy and security. Their encounter in a conflictual and unstable environment raises a host of questions and dilemmas, both moral and practical: should we balance democracy and security and if so how? Can the two be accommodated at all? Does democracy is better or worse in addressing security problems? Does democracy and security constitute each other conceptually? Do democratic states tend to cooperate with each other when confronting security issues? And what about democratization: how good a ca use is it as a foreign policy? How good a cause is it in justifying war and/or not ending one? From its establishment the State of Israel found itself torn by these and others related questions and the recent decades saw the US drawn by these dilemmas as well (think of the Bybee Memo and the Patriot acts). In the course we will introduce these dilemmas, analyze them and examine different normative and policy answers that were discussed in academia and in the policy world.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217164,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ish Shalom, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ish Shalom, P."],"location":"Encina West 202"}],"id":46234}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Their vastly different backgrounds challenge anyone attempting the puzzle. A further complication is the variety of ways in which the outside world may affect the scope and quality of democracy.

Why is violence (civil wars, ethnic conflict, military coups) so prevalent in the developing world, and how does it interact with development? Why do developing economies fail to generate high levels of income and wealth? We study how various kinds of development traps arise, preventing development for most countries.

It is explicitly grounded in philosophy of science (e.g., Popperian positivism and Kuhn's notions of paradigms and normal science).  Initial sessions address the meanings and roles of the concept of institutions in social-science research.  Historically important works of political science and/or economics are then considered within a framework called Components of Institutional Analysis (or CIA), which provides a fully general way of evaluating research that is jointly empirical and formal theoretical.  The course concludes with contemporary instances of such bridge-building. The over-arching objectives are to elevate the explicitness and salience of desirable properties of research and to illustrate the inescapable tradeoffs among the stipulated criteria.  nAlthough this is a core course in the GSB Political Economy PhD curriculum, its substantive foci may differ across years depending on the instructor.  For Professor Krehbiel's sessions, the emphasis is on legislative behavior, organization, and lawmaking, and on inter-institutional strategic interaction (e,g, between executive, legislative, and judicial branches in various combinations).  nStudents should have taken POLECON 680 and POLECON 681.

While most democracies have surprisingly short lifespans, America has persisted for 238 years. However, in the 21st century, we have grounds to question the quality of our democracy. Turnout of the Voting Age Population hovers around 50 percent and today, we are seeing increasing legal challenges to voting rights. In the backdrop of these statistics, there is an entire industry devoted to campaigns. In the 2012 presidential race alone, almost $2.5 billion was poured into the campaign-industrial complex. Given that this cycle is a presidential election year, those amounts are expected to be surpassed. As a consequence, many questions arise: How do politicians engage voters in elections at the various levels of government? Where do they spend their money and why? In the age of big data, how accurately can elections be predicted? How do we maximize participation in elections?","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":216498,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Cain, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"9:00:00 PM","instructors":["Cain, B."],"location":"Lathrop 296"}],"id":46967}],[]],"primary_type":"Activity"},

This has led to a widening gap in knowledge about the military, its members and the functions they perform, as well as its basic structure and tradition of service. This course is intended to introduce students to the notion of military service as public service and explore how misperceptions on both sides affect the civil-military divide. We will explore military service from the life of an enlisted soldier deployed to Afghanistan, to an officer working at the Pentagon on broad national security strategy. How does society conceive of a soldier, a sailor, an airman, a marine? How do Americans perceive military service and what role do service members play in our society?","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":216549,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Felter, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"6:00:00 PM","end":"7:50:00 PM","instructors":["Felter, J."],"location":"Encina East 207"}],"id":51951}],[]],"primary_type":"Activity"}}
