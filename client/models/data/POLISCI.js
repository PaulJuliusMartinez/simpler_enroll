But many moral problems arise from the fact that many individuals act together. This can lead to various dilemmas, in which what is individually rational is collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet. At the same time, the decisions of a single individual seem to have no tangible effect on climate change.  Such collective action situations give rise to a number of moral questions. Are individuals required to take their contributions  to wider systemic effects into account, even if they are negligibly small? For example, is it permissible to emit C02 on a Sunday afternoon road trip? Does it make a difference whether or not others are doing their fair share, for example with regard to fighting global poverty? In many cases, the best solution for collective action problems are institutions. But when these are deficient or non-existing, what should individuals do? Do they have a duty to assist in building institutions, and what would this duty imply in practical terms? We will approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, reading authors from philosophy, politics, economics and sociology such as Elinor Ostrom, Peter Singer or Liam Murphy, which we will relate to current questions such as the fight against global poverty and climate change.

Historically important works of political science and/or economics are then considered within a framework called Components of Institutional Analysis (or CIA), which provides a fully general way of evaluating research that is jointly empirical and formal theoretical.  The course concludes with contemporary instances of such bridge-building.

Challenges and opportunities abound: we live in an age of rising inequality, dazzling technological innovation, economic volatility, geopolitical uncertainty, and the accumulating impact of climate change. These conditions confront our political leaders and us as citizens of a democracy plagued by dysfunction. What are the implications for the body politic?  Led by Rob Reich (Political Science, Stanford), David Kennedy (History, Stanford), and James Steyer (CEO, Common Sense Media), the course will bring together distinguished analysts of American politics.  Together, we will examine the following topics: inequality; energy and the environment; media and technology; the economy; and the 2014 midterm elections.  The course is designed for the entire Stanford community: jointly offered for undergraduate and graduate students at Stanford (through listings in Political Science and History) and for community members through the Continuing Studies Program. For students, the course is available for 1 credit. This course may not be taken for a Letter Grade.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215694,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"9:00:00 PM","location":"Cemex Auditorium"}],"id":29242}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
