"180M":{"department":"ETHICSOC","number":"180M","title":"Collective Action: Ethics and Policy (PHIL 73)","description":"Individually rational actions can give rise to results that are collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet, destroy the world&#39;s fisheries, and increase reliance on factory farming; at the same time, the decisions of a single individual seem to have no tangible effect on such things. In light of this, what (if anything) are you as an individual required to do in these and other collective action situations, especially when others are not doing their part to prevent things from getting out of control? For example, are you required to reduce your carbon footprint and avoid products that are produced in ethically objectionable ways? Do you have a duty to vote? Is free-riding always ethically objectionable? Can you be required to &#39;cooperate&#39; in a situation where you know that most others will &#39;defect&#39;? Finally, from a real-world policy perspective, how can we bring about the best solutions to these and other collective action problems? Is the best policy response always a straightforward function of the variable features of each case? Interdisciplinary readings from authors in philosophy, politics, economics, and law such as Elinor Ostrom, Peter Singer, and Cass Sunstein.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ER"],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"12:30:00"}]}]]},

Do they mean that there are no moral norms in business or do they mean that there are special moral norms in business that differ from those of personal relationships and other spheres of social activity? In this class we will examine ethical questions that arise in the domain of business. We will ask, for example: What does the market reward and what should it reward? What are the moral responsibilities of a business owner in a competitive environment? Is it acceptable to employ &quot;sweatshop labor&quot;? How do the moral responsibilities of a business owner differ from that of a policy maker? What information does a seller (or buyer) have a moral duty to disclose? In real estate, is a strategic default morally wrong? How much government regulation of Wall Street is morally justified?  We will use the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, J. S. Mill, Marx, Jevons and Menger, Hayek, Walzer, and Sandel, among others, to help us answer these questions. We will see, for example, what Aristotle thought about day trading.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["EC-EthicReas","WAY-ER"],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}]]},

Should employers and schools be allowed to favor minority candidates? Is a ban on trans fat morally impermissible paternalism?
