The course aims to encourage students to consider moral problems in a reflective, systematic manner, and to equip students with skills that will enable them to do so. Questions to be addressed include: Do rich countries have an obligation to accept refugees from other parts of the world? Do such obligations conflict with the right of individuals to protect their culture? Is there anything principally wrong in the use of drones for purposes of warfare? Do we have obligations to the environment, and if so why? What is racism and what makes it wrong? And what are feminist ideals?","min_units":4,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ER", "GER:EC-EthicReas"],"id":209134,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":"60-120"}],"id":45892}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"371R":{"department":"ETHICSOC","number":"371R","title":"INEQUALITY: Economic and Philosophical Perspectives (ECON 380, PHIL 371D, POLISCI 431L)","description":"The nature of and problem of inequality is central to both economics and philosophy.  Economists study the causes of inequality, design tools to measure it and track it over time, and examine its consequences.  Philosophers are centrally concerned with the justification of inequality and the reasons why various types of inequality are or are not objectionable.nIn this class we bring both of these approaches together. Our class explores the different meanings of and measurements for understanding inequality, our best understandings of how much inequality there is, its causes, its consequences, and whether we ought to reduce it, and if so, how. nThis is an interdisciplinary graduate seminar. We propose some familiarity with basic ideas in economics and basic ideas in contemporary political philosophy; we will explain and learn about more complex ideas as we proceed. The class will be capped at 20 students.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":211243,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Arrow, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Arrow, K.","Satz, D."],"location":""}],"id":45916}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
