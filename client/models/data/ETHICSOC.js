Students will also have the opportunity to participate in a placement for 1 additional unit through the Haas Center with leaders of local non-profit organizations, foundations, and government offices. Through these experiential placements, students will see the responsibilities and challenges of leadership firsthand, across a variety of sectors and organizational settings. Placements are limited, and interested students should indicate their interest when applying. Requirements will include class participation and short written weekly reflection papers (2-3 pages) on the assigned readings.

Equity between people today and people tomorrow. Equity between the many diverse people today who are all trying to pursue their hopes and dreams. Equity between human beings and the myriad other living creatures we share this planet with. Movements for environmental sustainability and social justice share a concern for equity, but have largely evolved in parallel. Mounting evidence however shows that environmental and social change are almost always inextricably linked, and the climate crisis is pushing together these two areas of study like never before. That is good news, but tough questions remain. What happens when the environmental costs of personal freedom can no longer be sustained? Should the needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few? Are we responsible for repairing the injustices of our parents' and grandparents' generations? Where are the win-win solutions? In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will explore the theory and practice of sustainability and social justice, examining case studies where they have intersected, and where they have not. Readings will draw from sustainability science, environmental justice, environmental ethics, religious studies, social psychology, and ecological economics. Through weekly readings, discussions, and journal writing, students will develop a personal sustainability manifesto and analyze a policy, technology, or social movement through the lens of social and environmental sustainability.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-ER"],"id":217442,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lyons, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Lyons, A."],"location":"Lathrop 290"}],"id":46272}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lyons, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Lyons, A."],"location":"160-120"}],"id":57554}]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
