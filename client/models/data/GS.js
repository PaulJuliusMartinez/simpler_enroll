"46Q":{"department":"GS","number":"46Q","title":"Environmental Impact of Energy Systems: What are the Risks? (EARTHSYS 46Q)","description":"In order to reduce CO2 emissions and meet growing energy demands during the 21st Century, the world can expect to experience major shifts in the types and proportions of energy-producing systems.  These decisions will depend on considerations of cost per energy unit, resource availability, and unique national policy needs.  Less often considered is the environmental impact of the different energy producing systems: fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, and other alternatives.  One of the challenges has been not only to evaluate the environmental impact but also to develop a systematic basis for comparison of environmental impact among the energy sources.  The course will consider fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum and coal), nuclear power, wind and solar and consider the impact of resource extraction, refining and production, transmission and utilization for each energy source.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215471,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ewing, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ewing, R."],"location":"Green Earth Sciences134"}],"id":45100}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
