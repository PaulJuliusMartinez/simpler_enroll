{"121":{"department":"KORGEN","number":"121","title":"Doing the Right Thing:  Ethical Dilemmas in Korean Film (KORGEN 221)","description":"Ethics and violence seem to be contradictory terms, yet much of Korean film and literature in the past five decades has demonstrated that they are an intricate and in many ways justifiable part of the fabric of contemporary existence. Film exposes time and again the complex ways in which the supposed vanguards of morality, religious institutions, family, schools, and the state are sites of condoned transgression, wherein spiritual and physical violation is inflicted relentlessly. This class will explore the ways in which questions about Truth and the origins of good and evil are mediated through film in the particular context of the political, social, and economic development of postwar South Korea. Tuesday classes will include a brief introduction followed by a film screening that will last on average for two hours; students that are unable to stay until 5 pm will be required to watch the rest of the film on their own.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "WAY-ER"],"id":214083,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Zur, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Zur, D."],"location":""}],"id":28555}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
