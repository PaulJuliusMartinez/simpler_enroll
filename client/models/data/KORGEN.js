This class will look into the economic engine that moves this \"cultural contents\" industry, and will examine some of its expressions in the form of K-pop.

Film exposes time and again the complex ways in which the supposed vanguards of morality, religious institutions, family, schools, and the state are sites of condoned transgression, wherein spiritual and physical violation is inflicted relentlessly. This class will explore the ways in which questions about Truth and the origins of good and evil are mediated through film in the particular context of the political, social, and economic development of postwar South Korea. Tuesday classes will include a brief introduction followed by a film screening that will last on average for two hours; students that are unable to stay until 5 pm will be required to watch the rest of the film on their own.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "WAY-ER"],"id":214083,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Zur, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Zur, D."],"location":""}],"id":28554}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Have you danced along to \"Gangnam Style\"? As we become increasingly exposed to Asian popular culture and the Internet facilitates instant access to new media, previous localized forms of entertainment--animated cartoons, comics, video games, music videos, film, and soap operas--have become part of a global staple. However, these cultural forms have emerged not only in their original form with mediation of subtitles. Many have undergone various processes of adaptation and translation so that we no longer recognize that these products had ever originated elsewhere. This course will immerse students in a range of Japanese and Korean cultural phenomena to reveal the spectrum of translation practices across national boundaries. We will inquire into why these cultural forms have such compelling and powerful staying power, contextualize them within their frames of production, and explore the strategies, limitations, and potential of translational practices.nnContact instructor for place. dafnazur@stanford.edunKnight 201.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"id":216980,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Zur, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Zur, D."],"location":""}],"id":28733}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
