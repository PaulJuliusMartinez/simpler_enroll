{"343":{"department":"MGTECON","number":"343","title":"The Financial Crisis","description":"This class will focus on the evolution of the financial crisis and the implications for the future of financial markets and the economy. Part of the course will concern the history of the financial crisis, from 2008-12, including policy responses. The rest will focus on current events. There will be a number of guest speakers, either live or by Skype. Last year's list included Tanya Beder, John Geanakoplos, Bob Joss, Tom Kempner, Ken Rogoff, Larry Summers, Kevin Warsh, and Nancy Zimmerman. Myron Scholes participated in about half the classes. I assume that this year there will be a similar but not identical list.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":211169,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"13:15:00","end":"15:00:00","location":""}],"id":56813}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
