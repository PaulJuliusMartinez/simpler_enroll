"203":{"department":"MGTECON","number":"203","title":"Managerial Economics - Accelerated","description":"MGTECON 203 is the accelerated option in microeconomics for 1st year MBA students. It will cover the usual array of topics, with an emphasis on topics more useful for students of management (although the order in which the topics are covered will be different from that in 200). No previous background in economics is required or expected, but in comparison with MGTECON 200, less time will be spent in class on basic problems. Therefore, students choosing this option should be completely comfortable with calculus and linear algebra. A good diagnostic is to read Sections 3.5 and 3.6 (pp. 57-67) in Kreps, Microeconomics for Managers. If you find this easy, 203 is a good choice. If not, 200 is the right course for you. Students with extensive background in microeconomics should take one of the Advanced Applications options; in particular, MGTECON 203 is NOT a good fit for students who have an undergraduate major in economics.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":200388,},

Topics include demand and supply, cost structure, price discrimination, perfect competition, externalities, and the basics of game theory.

"249":{"department":"MGTECON","number":"249","title":"Smart Pricing and Market Design","description":"This is the Advanced Applications option in the menu of courses that satisfy the Management Perspectives requirement in Optimization and Simulation Modeling (OSM). The course is tailored to students who already have command of basic optimization and simulation techniques, or have an advanced mathematical background that will allow them to catch up quickly. The focus of the course is on applying these techniques to a particular business domain: pricing mechanisms and market design. The pricing component of the course will handle both traditional topics, such as price differentiation, and more modern ones, such as dynamic pricing. In the market design component of the course, we will apply optimization and simulation techniques to such topics as auctions (e.g., designing auctions for selling online advertising slots) and matching (e.g., designing mechanisms for matching students to schools). No background in economics or in the pricing and market design topics mentioned above is required or expected.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":216156,},

In this class, there will be a new topic each week, chosen only days in advance to ensure timeliness. Examples may include \"Janet Yellen's Monetary Policies\" or \"Economic Growth in Latin America\" or \"Thomas Piketty's New Book on Wealth Inequality.\" Students will divide into small groups, undertake research on a narrow question of their own choosing related to the general topic, and collectively write a 300-word blog entry to be posted on the (private) class blog at least 24 hours before class meets. Over the next day, students will read each others' entries. Finally, during class time, each group will lead a discussion of their blog post for 15-20 minutes.nnFor more information about this course, please see http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/MacroToday.html after January 15, 2015.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":216227,},

"364":{"department":"MGTECON","number":"364","title":"Motivation in Theory and in Practice","description":"This course focuses on one question: How do organizations motivate their key employees to provide consummate effort? By consummate effort, we mean effort above and beyond what is normal or expected, with particular emphasis on cases where the key employees are knowledge workers performing ambiguous and creative tasks.nnnWe will begin with three weeks or so of twice-weekly class sessions, at which different theories of motivation will be explored as theories and as practiced in case studies. This will include both the economic theory of incentives, but also social psychological theories of motivation and, in particular, on when and how economic forces and social psychological forces come into conflict and when and how they can be marshaled together.nnnDuring this initial three-week period, students in course will organize themselves into teams of 3 to 5 students. Each team will identify a organization or related group of organizations (say, several firms inside the same niche in an industry), and during weeks 4 through 7 of the quarter, each team will investigate how the organization(s) they are studying answer the basic question. Students will be expected to relate what they find to the theoretical constructs of the early part of the quarter. During this period, each team will meet at least weekly with the instructor to review progress achieved and to plan next steps. nnnIn the final two weeks or so (depending on the number of teams), teams will present what they have learned about the organizations they are studying to their peers. Each team will make a presentation of 45 minutes to an hour.  These presentations should include a full analysis of the organization(s) (any relevant history, business model and strategy, and so forth). They should then answer the basic question, giving to the greatest extent possible tangible measures and evidence for their assertions. This will be followed by a Q&A from the other members of the class, exploring what the teams have presented.nnnEach team will be expected to prepare a written \"case-let\" of their findings, to be circulated to other members of the class at least three days prior to the in-class discussion.  nnnOrganizations to be studied must be existing organizations. Teams will NOT be allowed to present \"designs\" for organizations that they are in the process of founding or that they hope to found. There must be evidence---anecdotal at least, more systematic if possible---of how well the organization's approach to motivation is working.nnnOrganizations studied should consent to be \"used\" in this fashion, although you will be asked to try to gain permission for the case-lets and your presentations to be used more broadly in the GSB's curriculum.  nnnThe instructor will attempt to \"recruit\" willing organizations, from which teams can choose, although it is equally preferable if not better for teams to identify on their own the organizations they will studied.nnnnGrades will be determined as follows:nnn20%--class participation in the first three weeks, with emphasis on contribution to case discussions.nn20%--group-assigned grade based on the written case-letnn30%--group-assigned grade based on the oral (in class) presentationnn20%--participation in the discussion of the presentations of other groups nn10%--based on an individual \"final exam,\" in which students will be asked to write a short report (three to five pages, double spaced, 12pt) evaluating what they learned, with emphasis on what they consider is important in answering the basic question, on the basis of the course experience. This report will be due on the last day of final exams, may be prepared off campus and emailed in. Students are free to discuss these matters with one another, but each student is expected to be the sole author of his/her \"final exam.\"nnnThere are no formal prerequisites for this course, but students considering this course will be well prepared if they have taken a course in human resource management. nnnThis course is a Bass Seminar and is limited to enrollment of 25 students.  nnnPlease note: I have a reputation for requiring a LOT of work from students. This reputation is deserved. I have every intention of enhancing my reputation in this regard, in this course, so caveat discipulus. (Unhappily, you cannot access course evaluation data on the number of hours that students report they work, so you will have to take my word for it: My courses are in the far upper tail of the distribution. You can access data on the question on \"Sets High Expectations.\"  And I urge you to read ALL the entries on me at Course Unofficial for MGTECON 200 and 203.)nnnIf you have any questions, please contact me in the first instance via email, at kreps@stanford.edu.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213692,},
