The oppressive politics of the Eastern Bloc regimes meant that artists were frequently compelled to respond to political pressure in their works.

In this course we will consider examples that conform to this frame--literature and film of political reform as well as models of Socialist Realism. In addition, however, we will also consider works of self-reflection, escapism, and every-day life under Socialism, in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of the cultural history of the era. The course will include literature and film produced by artists from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia.

"77Q":{"department":"SLAVIC","number":"77Q","title":"Russia's Weird Classic: Nikolai Gogol","description":"This seminar investigates the work and life of Nikolai Gogol, the most eccentric of Russian authors, the founder of what was dubbed Fantastic (or Magic) Realism. Our investigation will be based on close reading of the works written in various genres and created in various stages of Gogol's literary career. This study provides a perspective on the relationship between Romanticism and Realism in Russian literature (the so-called \"Natural School\" of the 1830-1840s), and between the popular Ukrainian culture and \"high\" Russian and West European traditions in Gogol's oeuvre. The seminar traces Gogol's influences on subsequent Russian literature (Dostoevsky in particular) and investigates the impact of his work on XX century modernist literature, theatre, music, and painting (Vladimir Nabokov, literature of the absurd, Dmitry Shostakovich, Marc Chagall). The seminar is intended for students interested in literature and literary studies.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["DB-Hum","WAY-A-II"],"id":119555,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"110-114"}],"id":26744}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
