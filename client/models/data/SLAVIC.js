Our investigation will be based on close reading of the works written in various genres and created in various stages of Gogol's literary career. This study provides a perspective on the relationship between Romanticism and Realism in Russian literature (the so-called \"Natural School\" of the 1830-1840s), and between the popular Ukrainian culture and \"high\" Russian and West European traditions in Gogol's oeuvre. The seminar traces Gogol's influences on subsequent Russian literature (Dostoevsky in particular) and investigates the impact of his work on XX century modernist literature, theatre, music, and painting (Vladimir Nabokov, literature of the absurd, Dmitry Shostakovich, Marc Chagall). The seminar is intended for students interested in literature and literary studies.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":119555,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Fleishman, L."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:50:00 PM","instructors":["Fleishman, L."],"location":"Green Earth Sciences134"}],"id":16053}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
