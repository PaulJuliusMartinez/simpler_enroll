This seminar will focus on issues related to achieving successful implementation of the goals of legislation.  It is widely recognized that the goals of legislation often are not realized and that the failure frequently rests in breakdowns in the implementation process by the agencies and organizations charged with implementing the legislation.  In response to problems in implementation, the institutional context of public policy implementation is changing. One category of innovations, known by names such as \"management-based regulation\" and \"evidence-based\" social service delivery, gives broad discretion to street-level service providers but subjects them to intensive monitoring and disciplined performance comparison.  Another category applies market concepts to regulation or social services, for example, by creating  tradeable rights (e.g., pollution allowances) or vouchers (for schools, housing, or healthcare). These, and other, new approaches are affecting both the contours of public law doctrine and the nature of lawyering in the public sector.  Lawyers in the public sector are increasingly drawing on skills of institutional design and monitoring of the kind associated with private sector transactional practice. The seminar will examine some of the emerging general themes of innovative policy implementation and look at a range of case studies. Topics will include the conditions under which financial and other rewards and sanctions are useful in bringing about desired behaviors, the pluses and minuses of the creation of markets as alternatives to government run programs, and efforts at improving implementation by improving management activities. Examples will be taken from both regulation and social services, and are likely to include environmental protection, education, child protective services, healthcare. food and workplace safety, nuclear power safety, and regulation of financial institutions.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212648,},

We will explore personal finance issues such as taxes, loans, charity, insurance, and pensions. Using the context of (hypothetical) personal finance positions, we will discuss the public policy implications of various proposals and how they affect different groups of people, for example: the implications of differential tax rates for different types of income, the promotion of home ownership in the U.S., and policies to care for our aging population. While economic policy will be the focus of much of the course, we will also examine some of the implications of social policies on personal finance as well.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"id":213171,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"8:50:00 PM","location":"Econ 139"}],"id":26675}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
