Against the backdrop of American culture and political history we examine how public policy has been and is being made. We use theories from Political Science and Economics to assess the state of the American system and the policy making process. We use case studies and lectures to analyze contemporary issues including environmental policy, taxes and spending , gun control , economic growth and inequality and mobility. In some of these issue areas we use comparative data from other countries to see how the U.S. is doing relative to other countries. In addition to class room lecture and discussion, student groups are formed to analyze policy issues of relevance to them.

This course will provide a broad overview of the scholarly field known as \"law and economics.\" The focus will be on how legal rules and institutions can correct market failures. We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differs from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs. Because this course is taught jointly with Law 528 in the Law School, it will not be mathematically oriented; there are no prerequisites to take the course.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":207637,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Polinsky, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:45:00 PM","instructors":["Polinsky, A.","Sheeler, P."],"location":"Law185"}],"id":45866}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Dagenais, G."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"5:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Dagenais, G."],"location":"160-318"}],"id":46970}],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},

What role do institutions play in resolving collective action problems? And what if the required institutions are absent? Can we, as individuals, be required to cooperate even if we expect that others may not play their part?
