This course will provide a broad overview of the scholarly field known as &quot;law and economics.&quot; The focus will be on how legal rules and institutions can correct market failures. We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differs from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs. Because this course is taught jointly with Law 528 in the Law School, it will not be mathematically oriented; there are no prerequisites to take the course.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,true,false,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"18:15:00"}]}],[]]},

This includes students from the law or business schools, or the public policy, economics, EES, political science, or financial math and engineering programs among others.  Several themes will tie the case studies, reading and discussions together:-Is this an example of an innovation that got too far ahead of existing operations, risk management, legal, accounting, regulatory or supervisory oversight?-How might temporary infrastructure be implemented without stifling innovation or growth?-How might losses be avoided by requiring permanent infrastructure sooner? Will Dodd-Frank, Basel III, etc., help to prevent such problems? What are the potential unintended consequences?-Is this an example of improperly viewing exposures that are subject to uncertainty or incorrectly modeling risk or both?

We will explore personal finance issues such as taxes, loans, charity, insurance, and pensions. Using the context of (hypothetical) personal finance positions, we will discuss the public policy implications of various proposals and how they affect different groups of people, for example: the implications of differential tax rates for different types of income, the promotion of home ownership in the U.S., and policies to care for our aging population. While economic policy will be the focus of much of the course, we will also examine some of the implications of social policies on personal finance as well.
