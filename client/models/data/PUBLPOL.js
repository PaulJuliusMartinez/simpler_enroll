We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such as regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differs from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs.

But many moral problems arise from the fact that many individuals act together. This can lead to various dilemmas, in which what is individually rational is collectively irrational. For example, the collective result of our consumption decisions is to warm the planet. At the same time, the decisions of a single individual seem to have no tangible effect on climate change.  Such collective action situations give rise to a number of moral questions. Are individuals required to take their contributions  to wider systemic effects into account, even if they are negligibly small? For example, is it permissible to emit C02 on a Sunday afternoon road trip? Does it make a difference whether or not others are doing their fair share, for example with regard to fighting global poverty? In many cases, the best solution for collective action problems are institutions. But when these are deficient or non-existing, what should individuals do? Do they have a duty to assist in building institutions, and what would this duty imply in practical terms? We will approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, reading authors from philosophy, politics, economics and sociology such as Elinor Ostrom, Peter Singer or Liam Murphy, which we will relate to current questions such as the fight against global poverty and climate change. No background will be assumed and no mathematical work will be required.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["EC-EthicReas","WAY-ER"],"id":213265,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:45:00 PM","location":""}],"id":19315}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
