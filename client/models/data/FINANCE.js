"385":{"department":"FINANCE","number":"385","title":"Angel and Venture Capital Financing and Decision Making","description":"This course covers all the stages of investment in early stage high-growth companies, from the seed funding of a novel idea to venture capital rounds to a successful exit, be it an M&A or an IPO. We will concentrate on how investors and entrepreneurs make and should make important decisions at different stages. Some questions that we will discuss are: How do angels and VCs generate and process their deal flow and select companies? What are typical mistakes of entrepreneurs in raising capital and negotiating with financiers? How do VC funds operate and make decisions? How are VCs involved in business decisions such as recruiting talent and replacing CEOs? What are the important provisions of financial contracts between VCs and founders? How to value early-stage companies? The course is mostly case-based and as a part of the course we will also simulate angel group and VC partners meetings. The course is for those who want to become entrepreneurs and thus likely consumers of angel and VC financing and those who want to pursue a career in the financial services industry. No prior knowledge of the VC industry is needed.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,true],"start":"13:15:00","end":"15:00:00"}]}],[],[]]}}
