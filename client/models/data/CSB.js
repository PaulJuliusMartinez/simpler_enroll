"261":{"department":"CSB","number":"261","title":"Quantitative Principles in Cell Differentiation","description":"Explores the common principles controlling cell differentiation from stem cells to terminally differentiated cells. Focus is on becoming familiar with the computational and single-cell experimental approaches that are needed to identify, probe, and dissect the dynamic decision to differentiate or de-differentiate in different cell systems including stem cells, adipocytes, neurons, pancreatic beta cells, cardiomyocytes, and hematopoietic cells. Topics include exploring how feedback mechanisms can be exploited to enable and precisely control tissue regeneration.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217550,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Teruel, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Teruel, M."],"location":"Li Ka Shing Center, room 308"}],"id":46509}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
