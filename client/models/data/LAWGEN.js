{"105Q":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"105Q","title":"Law and Popular Culture","description":"(Same as AMSTUD 105Q) This seminar focuses on the interface between two important subjects: law and popular culture. Before class, students will see a series of films or television shows relating to law, lawyers, and the legal system. There is also a weekly homework assignment based on materials in the assigned text and the assigned film or TV show. We will discuss the pop culture treatment of subjects such as the adversary system, good and bad lawyers, female and gay lawyers, the work life of lawyers, legal education, ethical issues, the jury system, and criminal and civil justice. The seminar discussions will draw on film theory and film-making technique to deepen understanding of the interrelationship between law and popular culture. The discussions will illuminate the ways in which pop culture products both reflect and change social views about law and lawyers. The assigned text is Michael Asimow & Shannon Mader, \"Law & Popular Culture: A Course Book\" (Peter Lang, 2d edition, 2013).","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213417,},
"111Q":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"111Q","title":"Introduction to International Human Rights","description":"This course will study the main international human rights declarations, treaties, covenants, committees, courts and tribunals.  It will look at the effect of nation states, regional bodies, and key economic and military organizations upon human rights.

"112N":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"112N","title":"Law and Inequality","description":"Most Americans know that discrimination on the basis of race, sex and religion is unlawful. Seems simple enough. But advertisements in the back of newspapers still announce: Single White Female Seeks Single White Male?  Isn't that discrimination on the basis of race and sex? Most businesses don't consider men for women's locker room or bathroom attendant. And why aren't those men and women's bathrooms and locker rooms illegal segregation?  After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites. Isn't it discrimination for an employer to insist that men wear a jacket and tie and women to wear nylons and a skirt? Why are some forms of discrimination unlawful and others not? Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people or people with annoying personalities not against the law? We'll answer these and many other questions by looking court cases, legal theory and philosophy. We may also have conversations with guest lecturers who work in civil rights enforcement and the seminar may include a field trip to visit the offices of civil rights lawyers (lawyers tend to be busy people so these opportunities will depend on their schedules.)  No prerequisites other than an open mind and a willingness to delve into unfamiliar material. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a short final paper.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215999,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30233}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

"114Q":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"114Q","title":"Dilemmas of Regulating Race and Inequality in American Society","description":"Is race an irrelevant characteristic to which we should all be blind? Do only racists pay attention to race? Or must we take account of race, as one Supreme Court Justice has urged, in order to get beyond it? Indeed, is race something that we should want to \"get beyond\"?  This seminar will consider the nature and extent of racial inequality, and how we as a society might and should respond to it. We will consider specific dilemmas regarding the propriety of taking account of race, in, for example, placing children with adoptive parents, selecting individuals for police investigation, hiring and college admissions. Readings will be drawn from law, history and social science. The goal of the course is to enable you to think more deeply about the moral, social and practical dimensions of how to regulate race in specific settings.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215995,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"5:30:00 PM","location":"Law271"}],"id":29929}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
"115N":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"115N","title":"Human Rights Advocacy","description":"What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed?  What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in human rights advocacy?  In the space of sixty years, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discussion, if not practice.  In this seminar we will examine the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates.  This seminar will introduce you to some the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights movement. We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.).  The seminar seeks to develop your ability: 1) to understand human rights and social justice issues as contested political, legal and cultural phenomena; 2) to review advocacy texts, videos and other interventions critically; 3) to appreciate the political dimensions of efforts to promote human rights;  4) to understand how recent history constrains and structures options and possibilities for social intervention to promote rights and justice.  During the course of the quarter you will be required to submit several short reflection papers and develop a human rights advocacy campaign.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215998,},
