{"103Q":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"103Q","title":"Depth Psychology","description":"Powerful unconscious forces impact human and social life. Depth psychology, founded by Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Wilhelm Reich, and others, studies these forces and how they shape inner life, personal relationships, religion, politics, art, and many other domains. The course draws from the founders, particularly Jung, and then goes on to include materials from modern theorists, primarily neo-Jungian. The starting point is how the unconscious and conscious mind interact in the individual person&#39;s life. We consider the implications of this interaction for psychotherapy and pathology as well as for ordinary life. On the social side, several sessions focus on religion and, to a lesser extent, mythology from a depth psychology perspective. The inquiry is open-ended throughout, encouraging personal reflection and engagement.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"19:15:00","end":"21:15:00"}]}],[],[]]},
"105Q":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"105Q","title":"Law and Popular Culture","description":"(Same as AMSTUD 105Q) This seminar focuses on the interface between two important subjects: law and popular culture. Before class, students will see a series of films or television shows relating to law, lawyers, and the legal system. There is also a weekly homework assignment based on materials in the assigned text and the assigned film or TV show. We will discuss the pop culture treatment of subjects such as the adversary system, good and bad lawyers, female and gay lawyers, the work life of lawyers, legal education, ethical issues, the jury system, and criminal and civil justice. The seminar discussions will draw on film theory and film-making technique to deepen understanding of the interrelationship between law and popular culture. The discussions will illuminate the ways in which pop culture products both reflect and change social views about law and lawyers. The assigned text is Michael Asimow &amp; Shannon Mader, &quot;Law &amp; Popular Culture: A Course Book&quot; (Peter Lang, 2d edition, 2013).","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:30:00"}]}],[]]},
"112Q":{"department":"LAWGEN","number":"112Q","title":"Law and Inequality","description":"Most Americans know that discrimination on the basis of race, sex and religion is unlawful. Seems simple enough. But advertisements in the back of newspapers still announce: Single White Female Seeks Single White Male?  Isn&#39;t that discrimination on the basis of race and sex? Most businesses don&#39;t consider men for women&#39;s locker room or bathroom attendant. And why aren&#39;t those men and women&#39;s bathrooms and locker rooms illegal segregation?  After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites. Isn&#39;t it discrimination for an employer to insist that men wear a jacket and tie and women to wear nylons and a skirt? Why are some forms of discrimination unlawful and others not? Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people or people with annoying personalities not against the law? We&#39;ll answer these and many other questions by looking court cases, legal theory and philosophy. We may also have conversations with guest lecturers who work in civil rights enforcement and the seminar may include a field trip to visit the offices of civil rights lawyers (lawyers tend to be busy people so these opportunities will depend on their schedules.)  No prerequisites other than an open mind and a willingness to delve into unfamiliar material. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a short final paper.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:10:00","end":"12:25:00"}]}],[]]}}
