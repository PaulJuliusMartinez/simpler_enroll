The problem isn&#39;t as widely discussed as distracted driving, but the danger is real.&quot; These two very different ways of circulating in urban space suggest that a major shift in how we humans relate to our environment has occurred over the course of nearly two centuries--especially in the densely populated spaces of modern cities. Where the great spectacle of urban life was a marvel of the nineteenth century, today&#39;s inhabitants want mainly to block it out by insulating themselves in a cocoon of favorite music or personal conversation, whether by voice or text, that they risk stepping into traffic, colliding with lightposts, or bumping into others similarly self-absorbed. This seminar proposes to think about the hows and whys of that important shift from the unique perspective of art history, a field of study especially attuned to the limits and exigencies of visual acuity. We will explore the topic across a range of media, from daguerreotypes to stereoscopes, from paintings to films, from television screen to the hand-held displays of our smartphones.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-AII"],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"16:45:00"}]}],[],[]]},

Each is a concentrated world, inviting an exhilarating closeness of response: why does this line come first? Why does the artist include that detail?

Over the course of the term, they will choose a selected group of art works from local museums (or focus on individual films) and then write an imaginary exhibition catalog centering on their choices.

"80N":{"department":"ARTHIST","number":"80N","title":"The Portrait: Identities in Question","description":"Most of us hold libraries of hundreds or thousands of ¿portraits¿ ¿ more or less instantly available posed images of ourselves and others. For most of human history, before the development of portable and digital cameras, portraiture was a much rarer and more deliberate social act and cultural practice, involving special materials and techniques, encounters with expert portraitists or photographers, and established settings for display. What almost all portraits, of whatever time or cultural place, have in common are presentations of social identities, roles, or persona, as well as a potential fascination and power that may be based in our neurological capacities for facial recognition and ¿mind-reading¿ through facial expressions.  This introductory seminar will explore many aspects of this basically simple category of thing ¿ images of particular persons.  Our point of departure will be from the history of art, focusing on portrait sculptures, paintings, and photographs from many eras and cultures, some of which are among the most studied and discussed of all artistic monuments.  We will consider techniques and approaches of portrait making, including the conventions that underlie seemingly realistic portraits, posing, the portrait situation, and portrait genres. Our primary focus will be on the multiple purposes of portraiture, from commemoration, political glorification, and self-fashioning to making claims of social status, cultural role, and personal identity. We will also discuss the changing status of portraiture under modern states of social dislocation, technological change, and psychoanalytic interrogation, and in postmodern conditions of multi-mediated realities and distributed subjectivities. Along the way, we will see that our understandings of portraiture benefits from the approaches and insights of many fields ¿ political and social history, anthropology, neuroscience, and literary studies among others.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:45:00"}]}]]},
