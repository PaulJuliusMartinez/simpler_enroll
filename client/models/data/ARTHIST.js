Yet potters, painters and even sculptors possessed little social standing. n nWhy did the Greeks value the work of craftsmen but not the men themselves? Why did Herodotus dismiss those who worked with their hands as \"mechanics?\" What prompted Homer to claim that \"there is no greater glory for a man&iquest; than what he achieves with his own hands,\" provided that he was throwing a discus and not a vase on a wheel?n nPainted pottery was essential to the religious and secular lives of the Greeks. Libations to the gods and to the dead required vases from which to pour them. Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers. At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children. Ceramic sets with scenes of Dionysian excess were reserved for elite symposia from which those who potted and painted them were excluded.n nSculptors were less lowly but even those who carved the Parthenon were still regarded as \"mechanics,\" with soft bodies and soft minds (Xenophon) \"indifferent to higher things\" (Plutarch).n nThe seminar addresses these issues.

"101":{"department":"ARTHIST","number":"101","title":"Archaic Greek Art (CLASSICS 161)","description":"In the decades 480-460, just before work began on the Parthenon, the sculptor Myron, creator of the Discus-Thrower, was even more celebrated for his bronze cow.  Ancient authors describe an image so palpably alive that shepherds threw stones at her, thinking that she had strayed from the herd, and bulls vied for her attention.  A century later, the quest for mimesis prompted a contest between two artists.  Zeuxis painted a bunch of grapes seductive enough to attract hungry birds; Parrhasios then added a linen curtain, which Zeuxis asked to be removed from his painting.  Zeuxis conceded defeat since he had fooled only birds, whereas Parrhasios had deceived an artist. nnThis course explores the art and culture of the ancestors of these men.  The Greeks of the archaic period (1000-480) would have understood the painters&iquest; competitive zeal, but only toward the end of the period would they have recognized naturalism as an artistic aim. nnEarlier Greek art is more abstract than life-like, closer to Calder than Michelangelo.  In the eighth century Homer&iquest;s descriptions of the rippling muscles (and egos) of his heroes, and the grief of Achilles&iquest; horses, evoke living men and sentient animals, but his fellow sculptors and painters prefer abstraction.nnThis changes in the seventh century as a result of commercial contacts with the Near East and Egypt.  Imported bronzes, ivories and other Near Eastern exotica alerted Greek artists to a wider range of subjects, techniques and intentions, including naturalism.  Later in the century, Greek expatriates learned the art of carving hard stone from Egyptian masters and soon marble sculpture and architecture spread throughout Greece. nnIn the course of the sixth and early fifth centuries Greek artists assimilate what they had borrowed, compete with one another, obey and disobey their teachers, test the tolerance of the gods and eventually produce works of art that speak with a Greek accent.  When the Persians invaded the Acropolis in 480 and 479, they encountered artifacts with little trace of alien influence or imprint and, at Salamis and Plataea, fought decisive battles in which the Greeks prevailed.  In the aftermath of the war, as the Greeks rebuilt their cities and their lives, Myron&iquest;s cow reminded them of their debts to other cultures and their resolve to remain true to their own.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":112453,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Maxmin, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,true],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:45:00 AM","instructors":["Maxmin, J."],"location":"Art4"}],"id":19156}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

It then considers how Athens and the rest of Greece proceed in the fourth century to rebuild their lives and the monuments that define them.  Earlier artistic traditions endure, with subtle changes, in the work of sculptors such as Kephisodotos.  Less subtle are the outlook and output of his son Praxiteles.  In collaboration with Phryne, his muse and mistress, Praxiteles challenged the canons and constraints of the past with the first female nude in the history of Greek sculpture.  His gender-bending depictions of gods and men were equally audacious, their shiny surfaces reflecting Plato&iquest;s discussion of Eros and androgyny.  Scopas was also a man of his time but pursued different interests.  Drawn to the inner lives of men and woman, his tormented Trojan War heroes and victims are still scarred by memories of the Peloponnesian War, and a world away from the serene faces of the Parthenon.  His famous Maenad, a devotee of Dionysos who has left this world for another, belongs to the same years as Euripides&iquest; Bacchae and, at the same time, anticipates the torsion and turbulence of Bernini and the Italian Baroque.  In the work of these and other fourth century personalities, the stage is set for Alexander the Great and his conquest of a kingdom extending from Greece to the Indus River.

From the fifteenth through the seventeenth century, European artists turned to the legends and poetry of Greco-Roman paganism for pictorial subjects. What roles could Venus and Mars, Mercury and Minerva play in a Christian culture? Artists and humanists had different answers to this question. As relics from the past the stories of the ancient gods could serve as the prehistory of worldly and religious institutions and hence legitimize them. Or pagan myth, because of its alien nature, could convey fantasies of the body, which could not be articulated otherwise. Among the artists who explored creatively the ancient legends were Donatello, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Velazquez, Rubens, Rembrandt, Bernini, and Poussin.

Modernism in art, architecture and design (e.g., Gauguin, Picasso, Duchamp, Mondrian, Le Corbusier, Breuer, Dali) will be explored as a compelling dream of utopian possibilities involving multifaceted and often ambivalent, even contradictory responses to the changes brought about by industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of mass culture.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":211054,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Troy, N."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:30:00 PM","instructors":["Troy, N."],"location":"Art4"}],"id":30728}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

From the Capitol Dome to a skeleton dug up in a highway project a hundred years after the last battle, the course will consider the strange and scattered remnants of a famous era.  Drawing on the poetry of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Herman Melville, the paintings of Winslow Homer, the photographs of Alexander Gardner, and the oratory of Abraham Lincoln, the course will examine what cannot be portrayed:  the trauma of war.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214296,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Nemerov, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"4:45:00 PM","instructors":["Nemerov, A."],"location":"Annaud"}],"id":30427}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Special attention is paid to how different technologies such as linear perspective, photography, cinema, and computer screens translate the visual experience into a representation; the automation of vision; and the intersection of technology with conceptions of time and space.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":213161,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Kessler, E."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:35:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","instructors":["Kessler, E."],"location":"Annaud"}],"id":30423}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
