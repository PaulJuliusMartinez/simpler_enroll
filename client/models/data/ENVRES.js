Though the seminar is open to all undergraduate and graduate students, our course is designed especially for those with a particular interest in studying and solving key issues of ocean policy and management, from coastal adaption to fisheries management to cumulative impacts assessments. In addition to this interest, students must be willing to take the time to dig deeper into the foundations of environmental thinking about the relationship of human beings and the sea.","min_units":1,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":202414,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lewis, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Lewis, S.","Urteaga Augier, J."],"location":"SpilkerEng&AppliedSci143"}],"id":46711}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
