This fall quarter course is intended as an introduction to these themes and problems. We begin this course with an examination of Kant's philosophy before approaching a number of texts that extend and further interrogate the critique of reason.  In addition to Kant, we will read texts by Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, Freud, Luk&aacute;cs, and Heidegger.nThis course is the first of a two-course sequence.  Priority to graduate students in MTL and English.  The course will be capped at 12 students.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":124294,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"120-314"}],"id":30079}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
