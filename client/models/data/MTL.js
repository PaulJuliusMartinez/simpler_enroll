{"334A":{"department":"MTL","number":"334A","title":"Concepts of Modernity I: Philosophical Foundations (ENGLISH 334A)","description":"In the late eighteenth century Immanuel Kant proclaimed his age to be \"the genuine age of criticism.\"  He went on to develop the critique of reason, which set the stage for many of the themes and problems that have preoccupied Western thinkers for the last two centuries.  This fall quarter course is intended as an introduction to these themes and problems. We begin this course with an examination of Kant's philosophy before approaching a number of texts that extend and further interrogate the critique of reason.  In addition to Kant, we will read texts by Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, Freud, Luk√°cs, and Heidegger.nThis course is the first of a two-course sequence.  Priority to graduate students in MTL and English.  The course will be capped at 12 students.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":124294,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":"Encina West 108"}],"id":32072}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
