"265":{"department":"DLCL","number":"265","title":"Histories and Futures of Humanistic Education: Culture and Crisis, Books and MOOCs (COMPLIT 265)","description":"This course looks at, and debates, certain features of online education specifically as they relate to the humanities and notions of engaged critical learning. It is a collaborative course. We will work in tandem with Professor Cathy Davidson¿s course at Duke, ¿The History and Future of High Education,¿ using live chats, Google documents, and other forums to interact with students at Duke (and at the University of Maryland and other colleges and universities nationally). Each campus will use a slightly different syllabus, linked to each instructor¿s particular angle into this general subject, but we will also have many readings and exercises in common. We see this as a critical moment in education, and connect this topic to its historical, cultural, political, and ethical implications.  Our Stanford course looks at early discussions about education and culture (Arnold¿s Culture and Anarchy) and then works through a key moment in the mid-twentieth century whose premises still have influence - the famous Two Cultures (humanities, sciences) debate. We next delve into the radical responses to educational reform in France and the US in the late 1960s, and finally consider the changing state of funding, value, and cultural critique in the late twentieth and early-twenty-first century. In particular we examine the idea of education as a personal, collective, and intensely intellectual endeavor which is shaped by and shapes societies.  We focus specifically on the idea of the ¿public good¿ and the relation between education and a democratic society.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"17:05:00"}]}],[]]},
