Humanities+Design investigates the role of the humanities in the challenges of interpreting data - especially 'big data'. Each student will participate in the design of visualization tools for humanities research, learning about the design process and design theory as it applies to digital humanities research. nThe course is targeted to students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students new to data-driven research.
