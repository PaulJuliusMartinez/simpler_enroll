As a foundations class, this survey of medieval culture engages in particular the art and architecture of the period.  The Middle Ages is presented as a network of global economies, fueled by a desire for natural resources, access to luxury goods and holy sites.  We will study a large geographical area encompassing the British Isles, Europe, the Mediterranean, Central Asia, India, and East Africa and trace the connectivity of these lands in economic, political, religious, and artistic terms from the fourth to the fourteenth century C.E.  The students will have two lectures and one discussion session per week.  Depending on the size of the class, it is possible that a graduate student TA will run the discussion session.  Our goal is to give a skills-oriented approach to the Middle Ages and to engage students in creative projects that will satisfy 1. Ways-Creative Expression requirement as well as one of the following two: Ways-Analytical Interpretive or Ways-Engaging Difference.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ED"],"id":215700,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:35:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30996}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Humanities research relies increasingly on digitized source material and, consequently, on data visualization as an interface for organizing and assessing as well as analyzing information. We will explore different ways of thinking about data visually, using visualization software under development to discover themes, questions and relationships.nIn an age where visual forms hold the force of persuasion, data visualization skills not only shape arguments but also help researchers engage critically with the information behind their analyses. Humanities+Design investigates the role of the humanities in the challenges of interpreting data - especially 'big data'. Each student will participate in the design of visualization tools for humanities research, learning about the design process and design theory as it applies to digital humanities research. nThe course is targeted to students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students new to data-driven research. All of our course meetings will take place in the at CESTA (Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis) on the 4th floor of Wallenberg Hall. There are no prerequisites for the class and the class is open to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":214444,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:00:00 PM","end":"4:00:00 PM","location":""}],"id":18670}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
