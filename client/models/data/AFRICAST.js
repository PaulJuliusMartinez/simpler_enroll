{"109":{"department":"AFRICAST","number":"109","title":"Running While Others Walk: African Perspectives on Development (AFRICAST 209)","description":"Throughout the history of modern Africa, Africans have specified their desired future¿development, understood broadly¿and identified the major obstacles in achieving it. Debates about development have intensified in the post-colonial period, especially as African countries have replaced the leaders installed at independence. Amidst the general critique of the imposition of external values and rules, Africans have differed, sometimes sharply, on priorities, process, and programs. While for some the challenge is to catch up with development elsewhere, for others it is essential to leap ahead, to set the pace, to initiate a radical social, economic, and political transformation. To ground and extend the common approaches to studying development that emphasize economics and that rely largely on external commentators, we will explore African perspectives. Our major task will be a broad overview, sampling the analyses of Africa¿s intellectuals in several domains. Course participants will review, compare, and analyze major contributions, developing an understanding of contemporary intellectual currents.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ED","WAY-SI"],"id":213891,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"15:15:00","end":"18:05:00"}],"id":36346}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

This class will introduce students to the culture and politics of science innnsub-Saharan Africa: to the diverse and rich traditions, histories and contemporarynnpredicaments of knowledge practices on the continent. We will consider the rolennof science in the colonial period, covering the expansion of European empires intonnAfrica and the forms of technical knowledge that colonial governments encountered, especially as they relate to health and the environment. We will examine the role of science at African independence and in international development work. Finally, we will discuss the techno-politics of medical training and research, resource extraction, and the internet in contemporary Africa. This course will provide some important background for those with an applied interest in Africa as well as provide an introduction to a growing area of scholarship. Course materials include historical and ethnographic works, as well as primary sources and films emphasizing scientific practice in the context of geopolitical relations of power and inequality.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214549,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"10:00:00","end":"11:50:00"}],"id":57169}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

The seminar will provide an introduction to island biogeography and culture, with emphasis on Madagascar.  During the seminar, students will give presentations on specific aspects of biogeography and will also lay the groundwork for the presentations they will be giving during the field seminar where access to the internet and to other scholarly resources will be quite limited. In addition, we will cover logistics, health and safety, cultural sensitivity, geography and politics, and basic language skills.  We will also deal with post-field issues such as reverse culture shock, and ways in which participants can consolidate and build up their abroad experiences after they return to campus.
