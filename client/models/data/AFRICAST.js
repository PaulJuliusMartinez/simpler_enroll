We will begin with a call made by the editor-in-chief of The Lancet for a literature of global health, namely fiction modeled on the social reform novels of the nineteenth century, meant to have helped readers develop a conscience for public health during its emergence as a modern specialty. We will then spend the quarter understanding how colonial, postcolonial, and world literatures may answer and complicate this call. Readings will include prose fiction by Albert Camus, Joseph Conrad, Tsitsi Dangaremgba, Amitav Ghosh, Susan Sontag as well as physician memoirs featuring Frantz Fanon, Albert Schweitzer, Abraham Verghese, Paul Farmer. And each literary reading will be paired with medical, philosophical, and policy writings that deeply inform the field of global health.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "WAY-ER", "GER:DB-Hum", "GER:EC-GlobalCom"],"id":215137,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ikoku, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Ikoku, A."],"location":"Green Earth Sciences150"}],"id":45987}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
