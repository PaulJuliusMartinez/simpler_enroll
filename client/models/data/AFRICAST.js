{"109":{"department":"AFRICAST","number":"109","title":"Running While Others Walk: African Perspectives on Development (AFRICAST 209)","description":"Throughout the history of modern Africa, Africans have specified their desired future&iquest;development, understood broadly&iquest;and identified the major obstacles in achieving it. Debates about development have intensified in the post-colonial period, especially as African countries have replaced the leaders installed at independence. Amidst the general critique of the imposition of external values and rules, Africans have differed, sometimes sharply, on priorities, process, and programs. While for some the challenge is to catch up with development elsewhere, for others it is essential to leap ahead, to set the pace, to initiate a radical social, economic, and political transformation. To ground and extend the common approaches to studying development that emphasize economics and that rely largely on external commentators, we will explore African perspectives. Our major task will be a broad overview, sampling the analyses of Africa&iquest;s intellectuals in several domains. Course participants will review, compare, and analyze major contributions, developing an understanding of contemporary intellectual currents.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ED","WAY-SI"],"id":213891,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"6:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":30804}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Working with three visiting social entrepreneurs from developing and developed country contexts students will use case studies of successful and failed social change strategies to explore relationships between social entrepreneurship, gender, democracy, development and justice. It interrogates current definitions of democracy and development and explores how they can become more inclusive of marginalized populations. This is a service learning class in which students will learn by working on projects that support the social entrepreneurs' efforts to promote social change.  Limited enrollment.
