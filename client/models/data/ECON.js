The centerpiece of this legislation known as 'devolution' transferred much responsibility for these programs to the states.  States had their first opportunity since the 'war on poverty' of the 1960s to undertake radical changes in setting up their public assistance programs.  Recently, many of the reforms instituted in the 1990s are being hotly debated and in some aspects reversed. What flexibility did the states receive under welfare reform, and what considerations are relevant in exercising this flexibility?  What selections have states made, and how are their programs and those of the federal government likely to evolve in the future?  This seminar will address these questions, exploring how reforms changed welfare and who has been affected by these changes.  In addition to covering the patchwork of different programs that currently constitute America's social safety net, the seminar will also scrutinize the makeup and trends in government spending and how our nation defines poverty and eligibility for income support.  Moreover, the discussion will illustrate the role that economics plays in assessing the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the consequences on families' behavior.

We will explore personal finance issues such as taxes, loans, charity, insurance, and pensions. Using the context of (hypothetical) personal finance positions, we will discuss the public policy implications of various proposals and how they affect different groups of people, for example: the implications of differential tax rates for different types of income, the promotion of home ownership in the U.S., and policies to care for our aging population.
