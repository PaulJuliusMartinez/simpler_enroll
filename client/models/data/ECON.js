The centerpiece of this legislation known as 'devolution' transferred much responsibility for these programs to the states.  States had their first opportunity since the 'war on poverty' of the 1960s to undertake radical changes in setting up their public assistance programs.  Recently, many of the reforms instituted in the 1990s are being hotly debated and in some aspects reversed. What flexibility did the states receive under welfare reform, and what considerations are relevant in exercising this flexibility?  What selections have states made, and how are their programs and those of the federal government likely to evolve in the future?  This seminar will address these questions, exploring how reforms changed welfare and who has been affected by these changes.  In addition to covering the patchwork of different programs that currently constitute America's social safety net, the seminar will also scrutinize the makeup and trends in government spending and how our nation defines poverty and eligibility for income support.  Moreover, the discussion will illustrate the role that economics plays in assessing the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the consequences on families' behavior.  Students will participate in a project in which they develop their own recommendations for devising a safety net for poor families in America.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"id":113246,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["MaCurdy, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"6:30:00 PM","end":"8:20:00 PM","instructors":["MaCurdy, T."],"location":"Econ 139"}],"id":16986}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

Economists study the causes of inequality, design tools to measure it and track it over time, and examine its consequences.  Philosophers are centrally concerned with the justification of inequality and the reasons why various types of inequality are or are not objectionable.nIn this class we bring both of these approaches together. Our class explores the different meanings of and measurements for understanding inequality, our best understandings of how much inequality there is, its causes, its consequences, and whether we ought to reduce it, and if so, how. nThis is an interdisciplinary graduate seminar. We propose some familiarity with basic ideas in economics and basic ideas in contemporary political philosophy; we will explain and learn about more complex ideas as we proceed. The class will be capped at 20 students.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":211243,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Satz, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Arrow, K.","Satz, D."],"location":""}],"id":45917}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
