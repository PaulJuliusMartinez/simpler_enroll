The centerpiece of this legislation known as 'devolution' transferred much responsibility for these programs to the states.  States had their first opportunity since the 'war on poverty' of the 1960s to undertake radical changes in setting up their public assistance programs.  Recently, many of the reforms instituted in the 1990s are being hotly debated and in some aspects reversed. What flexibility did the states receive under welfare reform, and what considerations are relevant in exercising this flexibility?  What selections have states made, and how are their programs and those of the federal government likely to evolve in the future?  This seminar will address these questions, exploring how reforms changed welfare and who has been affected by these changes.  In addition to covering the patchwork of different programs that currently constitute America's social safety net, the seminar will also scrutinize the makeup and trends in government spending and how our nation defines poverty and eligibility for income support.  Moreover, the discussion will illustrate the role that economics plays in assessing the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the consequences on families' behavior.

In recent years market designers have participated in the design and implementation of a number of marketplaces, and the course will emphasize the relation between theory and practice, for example in the design of labor market clearinghouses for American doctors, and school choice programs in a growing number of American cities (including New York and Boston), and the allocation of organs for transplantation.  Various forms of market failure will also be discussed.nnAssignment:  One final paper.
