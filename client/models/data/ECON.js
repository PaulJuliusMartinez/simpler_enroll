The centerpiece of this legislation known as 'devolution' transferred much responsibility for these programs to the states.  States had their first opportunity since the 'war on poverty' of the 1960s to undertake radical changes in setting up their public assistance programs.  Recently, many of the reforms instituted in the 1990s are being hotly debated and in some aspects reversed. What flexibility did the states receive under welfare reform, and what considerations are relevant in exercising this flexibility?  What selections have states made, and how are their programs and those of the federal government likely to evolve in the future?  This seminar will address these questions, exploring how reforms changed welfare and who has been affected by these changes.  In addition to covering the patchwork of different programs that currently constitute America's social safety net, the seminar will also scrutinize the makeup and trends in government spending and how our nation defines poverty and eligibility for income support.  Moreover, the discussion will illustrate the role that economics plays in assessing the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the consequences on families' behavior.  Students will participate in a project in which they develop their own recommendations for devising a safety net for poor families in America.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SI"],"id":113246,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["MaCurdy, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"7:00:00 PM","end":"9:15:00 PM","instructors":["MaCurdy, T."],"location":"Econ 139"}],"id":19059}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

Building on a basic knowledge of statistical methods and economics, the course first introduces observational field research and compares it with experimental field research. Significant attention will be devoted to explaining what can and cannot be learned each type of field research.  The details of designing both types of field research projects will then be discussed.  The basics theory of the design of statistical experiments will be introduced and applied.  Topics covered include sample size selection, power and size of statistical hypothesis tests, sample selection bias and methods for accounting for it.  Examples of best practice field research studies will be presented as well as examples of commonly committed errors.

"158":{"department":"ECON","number":"158","title":"Regulatory Economics","description":"Economics 158 examines public policies for dealing with problems arising in markets in which competitive forces are weak. The focus is on monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and other environments where market mechanisms are unlikely to produce outcomes that benefit consumers more than the alternatives involving costly government intervention. The two main areas examined are competition policy and economic regulation. Competition policy refers to laws that define certain market behavior as illegal because it is harmful to competition or fails to provide consumer benefits that justify its costs to consumers. Economic regulation refers to policies in which government controls prices and/or decides the terms and conditions under which firms can participate in a market. A growing area of study and policy design is the introduction of market mechanisms into formerly regulated industries such as: telecommunications, electricity, airlines, railroads, postal delivery services and environmental regulation.

It will emphasize the combined use of economic theory, experiments and empirical analysis to analyze and engineer market rules and institutions. In this first quarter we will pay particular attention to matching markets, which are those in which price doesn&iquest;t do all of the work, and which include some kind of application or selection process. In recent years market designers have participated in the design and implementation of a number of marketplaces, and the course will emphasize the relation between theory and practice, for example in the design of labor market clearinghouses for American doctors, and school choice programs in a growing number of American cities (including New York and Boston), and the allocation of organs for transplantation.  Various forms of market failure will also be discussed.nnAssignment:  One final paper. The objective of the final paper is to study an existing market or an environment with a potential role for a market, describe the relevant market design questions, and evaluate how the current market design works and/or propose improvements on the current design.","min_units":2,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":208829,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Roth, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:50:00 PM","instructors":["Niederle, M.","Roth, A."],"location":"Econ 139"}],"id":26074}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
