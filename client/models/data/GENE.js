Explores the role of scientific experts in patent infringement litigation. In other areas of the law where scientific experts are used -- medical malpractice, environmental law, criminal law -- the science itself is often in dispute.  In patent cases, however, the parties generally agree on the science. This affects the relationship between the lawyer and the expert and the substantive content of their interactions. Patent experts need to be able to explain science to the judge and jury.  But they also must help the litigators choose which legal issues to press and which to concede, and to be aware of how the complications of the science might help, hurt, obscure or reveal how the law should be applied to the facts. The class examines judicial decisions and trial documents involving scientific evidence in patent litigation, followed by work in teams on final projects: simulations of expert testimony in a patent case. Simulations are performed at the end of the quarter before panels of practicing patent lawyers.
