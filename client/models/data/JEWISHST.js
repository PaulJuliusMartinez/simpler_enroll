We will study the different understandings and definitions of the separation of \"church and state\" in Western democratic cultures, and the differing notions of the \"public sphere.\" Through case studies, we will investigate the nature of public conflicts, what particular issues lead to conflict, and why. For instance, why has the head covering of Muslim girls and women become politicized in Europe, and how? What are the arguments surrounding the Cordoba House, known as the Ground Zero Mosque, and how does this conflict compare to the controversies surrounding recent constructions of mosques in European cities? The course is interdisciplinary and comparative in nature. It considers historical, political, sociological, and religious studies approaches, introducing students to the particular perspectives of these disciplines.
