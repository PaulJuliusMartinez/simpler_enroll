Dietary laws prescribe which animals are and are not \"kosher\" and what can be eaten with them, holidays are celebrated with traditional foods, and regional foods contribute to the formation of distinct Jewish ethnic identities. More recently, American Jews have begun to organize around issues of  food justice, and joined the sustainability movement, adapting Jewish traditions about food production into their cause.

"71":{"department":"JEWISHST","number":"71","title":"Jews and Christians: Conflict and Coexistence (RELIGST 71)","description":"The relationship between Judaism and Christianity has had a long a controversial history. Christianity originated as a dissident Jewish sect but eventually evolved into an independent religion, with only tenuous ties to its Jewish past and present. At the same time, Judaism has at times considered Christianity a form of idolatry. It seems that only since the catastrophe of the Holocaust, Jews and Christians (Catholics and Protestants) have begun the serious work of forging more meaningful relationships with each other. This course explores the most significant moments, both difficult and conciliatory ones, that have shaped the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and introduces students to some of the most important literature, art, and music that are part of it. nSelected literature: Gospel according Matthew, the letters of St. Paul, St. Augustine, the Talmud (selections), Maimonides, Martin Luther's sermons on the Jews, Nostra Aetate (Vatican II)nArt and Music: Medieval art and sculpture, Haendel's Messiah.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum", "WAY-ED"],"id":214191,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Fonrobert, C."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:50:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","instructors":["Fonrobert, C."],"location":"110-101"}],"id":19583}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
