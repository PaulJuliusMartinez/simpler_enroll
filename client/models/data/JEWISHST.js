In the context of a national and territorial conflict, the Israeli state fostered comprehensive nation-building projects (such as immigration absorption), via employment and social protection schemes. This course surveys the distinctive development of the Israeli welfare state in comparative perspective, and analyzes its particular politics and outcomes in the form of inclusion but also exclusion of different populations from full citizenship. The course will follow a chronological path from the pre-state crystallization of national welfare institutions  to the current neo-liberalization trend that seems to undermine collectivist projects and advance the re-commodification of citizenship. Throughout the course we will discuss issues such as: the role of labor and nationalism in the design of social policy, the production of national, ethnic and gender inequality, and the dynamics of change and continuity following heightened liberalization and internationalization since the 1980s. The course exposes students to key issues of the sociology of the welfare state with particular emphasis on the development and role of the state in a deeply conflicted society, using the Israeli experience. At the conclusion of the course students are expected to understand how welfare state institutions reflect but also reproduce societal schisms and conflicts, and be familiar with central aspects of Israeli politics past and present.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217088,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Maron, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Maron, A."],"location":"160-323"}],"id":30820}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

The institutions of citizenship include formal and bureaucratic rules of eligibility &iquest; but also informal institutions such as identity and belonging.

Moreover, the volatility brings into encounter two kinds of collective goods: democracy and security. Their encounter in a conflictual and unstable environment raises a host of questions and dilemmas, both moral and practical: should we balance democracy and security and if so how? Can the two be accommodated at all? Does democracy is better or worse in addressing security problems? Does democracy and security constitute each other conceptually? Do democratic states tend to cooperate with each other when confronting security issues? And what about democratization: how good a ca use is it as a foreign policy? How good a cause is it in justifying war and/or not ending one?

We will take a close look at novels by Israelis, both Jewish and Arab, in order to understand multiple perspectives, and we will also consider works by authors from the North America and from Europe.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "WAY-ED"],"id":215452,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Berman, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Berman, R."],"location":"260-011"}],"id":15958}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

"71":{"department":"JEWISHST","number":"71","title":"Jews and Christians: Conflict and Coexistence (RELIGST 71)","description":"The relationship between Judaism and Christianity has had a long a controversial history. Christianity originated as a dissident Jewish sect but eventually evolved into an independent religion, with only tenuous ties to its Jewish past and present. At the same time, Judaism has at times considered Christianity a form of idolatry. It seems that only since the catastrophe of the Holocaust, Jews and Christians (Catholics and Protestants) have begun the serious work of forging more meaningful relationships with each other. This course explores the most significant moments, both difficult and conciliatory ones, that have shaped the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and introduces students to some of the most important literature, art, and music that are part of it. nSelected literature: Gospel according Matthew, the letters of St. Paul, St. Augustine, the Talmud (selections), Maimonides, Martin Luther's sermons on the Jews, Nostra Aetate (Vatican II)nArt and Music: Medieval art and sculpture, Haendel's Messiah.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum", "WAY-ED"],"id":214191,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"School of Education 206"}],"id":43583}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
