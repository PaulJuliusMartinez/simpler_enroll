How can learning environments be better structured to support the success of all students? In this class, we will explore how a variety of identities such as race, gender, social class, and athletic participation can affect academic achievement, with the goal of identifying concrete strategies to make learning environments at Stanford and similar universities more inclusive. Readings will draw from psychology, sociology, education, and popular press. This class is a seminar format.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":216656,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Crosby, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":["Crosby, J."],"location":"Sweet403"}],"id":45755}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

Numbers are limited and so whether formally registered (grad students) or attending as auditors (grad students or postdocs), all participants must commit to attending the entire course. Begins with a methodology to help determine if a faculty career is a good fit for the values, interests and abilities of each participant. Progresses to an exploration of different types of faculty roles and different institutional contexts (e.g., tenure-track vs. non-tenure-track; research-intensive vs. teaching-intensive; large vs. small; etc.). Discusses how to identify and land a faculty position. Ends with concrete tips on how to thrive in such a role. May be repeated for credit.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":210417,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sugiura, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Sugiura, R.","Boothroyd, J."],"location":"Lathrop 282"}],"id":47633}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

It provides doctoral and masters students with an opportunity to focus on teaching and learning along with graduate students from many disciplines throughout the university.  Students watch and interview master teachers at Stanford, prepare a syllabus module for a workshop or class they might teach, and learn a range of effective pedagogical methods.  The course is open not only to masters students and doctoral students from all schools who expect to work in higher education, but also to students interested in K-12 education, and they may develop a teaching module for use in those schools.","min_units":1,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":211458,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Denman, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Richardson, R.","Denman, M.","Ehrlich, T."],"location":"Ceras 204"}],"id":44717}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
