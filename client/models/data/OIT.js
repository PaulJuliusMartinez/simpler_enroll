Our goal is to teach you how to evaluate quantitative information and to make sound decisions in complex situations. 'D&D' combines two areas of management science: The first area, probability, provides a foundation for modeling uncertainties, such as the uncertainties faced by financial investors or insurers. We will study the mechanics of probability (manipulating some probabilities to get others) and the use of probability to make judgments about uncertain events. The second area, statistics, provides techniques for interpreting data, such as the data a marketing department might have on consumer purchases. Statistical methods permit managers to use small amounts of information (such as the number of people switching from Verizon to AT&T in an iPhone test marketing program) to answer larger questions (what would AT&T's new market share be if the iPhone is launched nationally?)","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":214635,},

This course survey the problems and the cost they impose on society. It describes a series of pilot projects which aim to develop principles for inducing small changes in behavior in Societal Networks--transportation networks, wellness programs, recycling systems and, if time permits, energy grids. Students will learn how low-cost sensing and networking technology can be used for sensing individual behavior, and how incentives and social norming can be used to influence the behavior. The effectiveness of this approach in pilots conducted in Bangalore (commuting), Singapore (public transit system), Stanford (congestion and parking), and a wellness program at Accenture-USA will be discussed.

Data on customers' preferences are collected through websites or loyalty programs or cash registers. Data on employees' traits are collected through in-house databanks or social networking sites. All of us are used to thinking about data. How can you make data relevant to doing your job? How can data analysis serve to increase your competitive advantage over that of others? This class goes beyond graphing data in bar charts or time trends. It makes you think about causal relationships. The examples we use are primarily taken from talent management, because it's easy to think about our own careers or those of our employees. But the tools covered extend to all contexts, and your project is on an idea of your choosing. The class focuses on the use of regressions to think experimentally. To take the class, you should have covered regression analysis in a former class (such as an econometrics course for economics majors) or be comfortable with learning basic math concepts quickly. You also should understand distributions of data (such as the Bell curve, or normal distribution), but this topic is not covered. There are no required proofs or derivations; you've done that as undergraduates. This is about using data: we use cases, examples, Notes written for the class, and a quiz, final exam, and several assignments in which you play with data sets to answer questions. Note that this 4-unit course, if successfully completed, counts for the Data Analysis foundations requirement.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":212734,},

Our projects this year will focus on services for young adult survivors of severe childhood diseases. For the first time ever, children who have cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, major cardiac repairs, organ transplants, genetic metabolic disorders, and several forms of cancer are surviving. The first wave of these survivors is reaching young adulthood (ages 18-25). Many aspects of the young adult world are not yet user-friendly for them: applying to and then entering college, adherence to required medication and diet, prospects for marriage and parenthood, participation in high school or college sports, driving, drinking, drugs, and more. Our aspiration is to develop services to improve these young adults? options for a fulfilling and satisfying life.

"361":{"department":"OIT","number":"361","title":"Technology Concepts for Managers","description":"Electronics, computing, networks and software applications have become an integral part of business. The course is aimed at the student who wishes to learn those electronic and computer science concepts needed to understand how computers, networks, and the software that runs them operate, but who lacks background in engineering or computer science. The premise of the course is that adequate knowledge of technology is now a prerequisite for a successful manager, but that knowledge does not have to be at the level of rigor required in the practice of engineering or computer science. This course is intended to provide a basic literacy in these areas, with an emphasis on implications for managers and organizations. A meaningful course that focuses on particular technologies is difficult because rapid changes in any technology can quickly render today's lessons obsolete. Therefore, this course will stress fundamentals and trends, rather than a snapshot of the current status of different technologies. As a result, classroom coverage of current \"hot\" topics in technology is subordinate to giving the technology concepts necessary for one to learn such current (and future) topics on their own. Investigation of technology will be facilitated by lectures readings and homework assignments. Students will have an opportunity to investigate and learn more about a particular technology in more depth as part of a term project. nnnThe general flow of the course will focus upon four areas approximately as follows: Part I Electronic Systems: Fundamental Electronics (2 sessions), Digital and Microelectronics (2 sessions), Computer Hardware and Systems (2 sessions), Technology Trends (1 session), Communications including wireless (2 sessions); Part II Networks: Networked Computing (1 session), the Internet (2 sessions); Part III Software: Software and software development (3 sessions), Data Base Technology (1 session); and Part IV The Web: Clients and Servers (1 session), Case study of a web site (1 session), Video/Multimedia (1 session). nnnThe course is specifically designed for students with liberal arts or soft science backgrounds who have career ambitions in high-tech or who wish to be more technically aware as managers. Students with hard science, engineering or computer science backgrounds are welcome but must avoid redirecting the class discussion into narrow or advanced material that causes dysfunction to less technical colleagues. Students may elect either to take a final exam or do a term project. Students electing to do a term project will create it as a Web page.

In this course, students learn how to develop comprehensive solutions (most commonly medical devices) to some of the most significant medical problems. The first quarter includes an introduction to needs finding methods, brainstorming and concept creation. Students learn strategies for understanding and interpreting clinical needs, researching literature and searching patents. Working in small entrepreneurial multidisciplinary teams, students gain exposure to clinical and scientific literature review, techniques of intellectual property analysis and feasibility, basic prototyping and market assessment. Students create, analyze and screen medical technology ideas, and select projects for future development. Final presentations at the end of the winter quarter to a panel of prominent inventors and investors in medical technology provide the impetus for further work in the spring quarter. Course format includes expert guest lecturers (Thu: 4:15 to 6:05 pm), faculty-led practical demonstrations and coaching sessions and interactive team meetings under the mentorship of Biodesign fellows (Tues: 4:15 to 6:05 pm). Projects from previous years included: prevention of hip fractures in the elderly; methods to accelerate healing after surgery; less invasive techniques for bariatric surgery; point of care diagnostics to improve emergency room efficiency; novel devices to bring specialty-type of care to primary care community doctors.
