Fundamentals of the MATLAB computing environment, programming and debugging, data import/export, data structures, plotting, image analysis, introduction to statistical tools. Examples and assignments draw from a range of topics applicable to bioscience research: frequency analysis, genetic data mining, ion channel kinetics, neural spike rasters and spike-triggered averages, cell counting in fluorescence images, regression, PCA, and stochastic simulation. Assignments are practical in nature and demonstrate how to implement specific analyses that a biosciences student is likely to encounter.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":212760,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Naecker, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"11:30:00 AM","instructors":["Maheswaranathan, N.","Trautmann, E.","Naecker, B.","Huguenard, J."],"location":""}],"id":26730}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lab"}}
