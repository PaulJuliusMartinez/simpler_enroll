Addresses two central questions of neural computation: How do neurons compute; and how do networks of neurons encode/decode and store information? Focus is on biophysical (Hodgkin-Huxley) models of neurons and circuits, with emphasis on application of commonly available modeling tools (NEURON, MATLAB) to issues of neuronal and network excitability. Issues relevant to neural encoding and decoding, information theory, plasticity, and learning. Fundamental concepts of neuronal computation; discussion focus is on relevant literature examples of proper application of these techniques. Final project. Recommended for Neuroscience Program graduate students; open to graduate, medical, and advanced undergraduate students with consent of instructor. Prerequisite: NBIO 206.
