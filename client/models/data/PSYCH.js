Over the course of the semester, students will be challenged to think critically about research from psychology, sociology, and medicine, which suggests that what we think, believe and expect plays a significant role in determining our physical health, performance and well-being. Students will explore research on how mindsets about nutrition, exercise, and stress can alter the body&iquest;s response to those phenomena.  Students will also uncover how social interactions with friends, family, colleagues and the media influence the perceived quality and impact of cultural products such as art, music, and fashion.  And students will learn about the neurological and physiological underpinnings of the placebo effect, a powerful demonstration of expectation that produces real, healing changes in the body.  Finally, students will have the opportunity to consider real world applications in disciplines including policy, business, medicine, academics, athletics and public health and consider the ethical implications of those applications.  Throughout the class active participation and an open mind will be critical to success. The final weeks of class will be dedicated to student designed studies or interventions aimed to further explore the power of self-fulfilling prophecies, placebo effects, and the social-psychological creation of reality.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215592,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Crum, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"4:15:00 PM","end":"6:05:00 PM","instructors":["Crum, A."],"location":"200-107"}],"id":20438}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

This seminar will review methods, principal results, and ideas for designing devices that either act on or read out data from the nervous system. A principal objective of designing these devices is to use them for sensory prosthetics (retinal implants and motor control units), and also for reducing the symptoms of different diseases (Parkinsons, Depression, Epilepsy). We will consider a wide variety of applications, but our emphasis will be on electronic devices that either stimulate or read-out from the human brain.","min_units":1,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":214839,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Wandell, B."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","instructors":["Wandell, B."],"location":"420-102"}],"id":19032}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

We will also explore the deeper ethical and philosophical issues that arise from our ability to peer into our own brains in action. The course will start by discussing how to understand and interpret the findings of brain imaging research. We will discuss how new statistical methods provide the ability to accurately predict thoughts and behaviors from brain images. We will explore how this research has the potential to change our concepts of the self, personal responsibility and free will. We will also discuss the ethics of brain imaging, such as how the ability to detect thoughts relates to personal privacy and mental illness.
