Early childhood is a time of both enormous promise and considerable risk, and parents in different cultures have widely differing practices and beliefs about their role in enabling children to avoid risk and achieve their potential.  In this seminar we will evaluate evidence from the biological and social sciences showing how positive and negative experiences in infancy have profound and enduring effects on early brain architecture, with cascading consequences for later development in childhood and adulthood.  We will also consider the challenges of designing more effective programs and social policies to provide support for families in diverse cultural contexts, with the goal of helping more children to reach their full potential.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":217090,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Fernald, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Fernald, A."],"location":"420-050"}],"id":47261}]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

What have we learned, where have we fallen short, and why? Most importantly, how can we make the most out of these new methods to bear on our understanding of social cognition and its development?  After the first two weeks of lectures on basic methods, each week we will consider a topic that has been extensively studied in cognitive development literature.

The methods are indeed very powerful, but many of the claims seen in the press are results of overly strong interpretations. In this course, you will learn to evaluate claims based on brain imaging research. We will also explore the deeper ethical and philosophical issues that arise from our ability to peer into our own brains in action. The course will start by discussing how to understand and interpret the findings of brain imaging research. We will discuss how new statistical methods provide the ability to accurately predict thoughts and behaviors from brain images. We will explore how this research has the potential to change our concepts of the self, personal responsibility and free will. We will also discuss the ethics of brain imaging, such as how the ability to detect thoughts relates to personal privacy and mental illness. Finally, we will discuss the legal implications of these techniques, such as their use in lie detection or as evidence against legal culpability.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-ER", "WAY-SMA"],"id":215540,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Poldrack, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:30:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":["Poldrack, R."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":43002}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
