Focuses on how conflicting ideas about race, gender, ethnicity, and citizenship with respect to particular groups led to policies both of exclusion and integration. Part One begins with the ways in which the American views of race and citizenship in the colonial period through the post-Reconstruction Era led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and subsequently to broader exclusions of immigrants from other parts of Asia, Southern and Eastern Europe, and Mexico. Explores how World War II and the Cold War challenged racial ideologies and led to policies of increasing liberalization culminating in the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, which eliminated quotas based on national origins and opened the door for new waves of immigrants, especially from Asia and Latin America. Part Two considers new immigration patterns after 1965, including those of refugees, and investigates the contemporary debate over immigration and immigration policy in the post 9/11 era as well as inequalities within the system and the impact of foreign policy on exclusions and inclusions.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":["DB-SocSci","WAY-ED","WAY-SI"],"id":211293,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:35:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"School of Education 206"}],"id":16427}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

"22SC":{"department":"HISTORY","number":"22SC","title":"A Tale of Two Cities: London and San Francisco","description":"San Francisco and London are two of the world's best-loved and most-visited cities. They have certain things in common: both are ports, situated on the edge of continents; both are major commercial and cultural centres; and both have been shaped by immigration. Their differences are more obvious than their similarities, however, and these differences are to a large extent explained by their very different histories. London was founded by the Romans and was, for a period in its recent history, the capital of an Empire on which the sun famously never set; San Francisco did not emerge as a city until well into the 19th century and even now has something of the character of a \"city state\" rather than a national or state capital. Though often considered one of the most European of American cities, San Francisco is in fact laid out on the typically American grid plan; the planning of London is, by contrast, chaotic, reflecting its long evolution and the lack of any effective central planning control. nThe course will explain the ways in which these two fascinating cities have evolved, especially over the past 200 years. We will focus on the development of what is sometimes called the \"urban landscape\"--streets, public buildings, housing, open spaces, transport systems--and investigate who made the decisions that shaped the two cities as we experience them today. We will look not only at the impact of major events--the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, the bombing of London during World War II--but also at the small decisions made by property owners and developers which helped determine the character of urban neighborhoods. We will use maps and primary documents as well as published histories, and there will be at least two field trips to explore buildings and neighborhoods in San Francisco. Students will write two papers, each of 4-5-pages, on aspects of the history of each city.

In philosophy, Ren&eacute; Descartes challenged all traditional learning and defined new principles that were central to the so-called &iquest;Revolution of the Mind.&iquest; In religion, Enlightenment thinkers not only advocated the toleration of different faiths but also questioned the veracity of Christianity and of all theistic worldviews. In politics, the French Revolution redefined the very concept of a political revolution and set the stage for modern conceptions of sovereignty. French socialist thinkers of the 19th century, in turn, reshaped the ways their contemporaries thought about socio-economic arrangements. Finally, 20th-century existentialists have attempted to rethink the very purpose of human existence. In this course, we will explore these and other seminal revolutionary moments that not only transformed French society, but that also had implications for European and, indeed, global culture.

Since Herodotus, history and memory have competed to shape minds: history cultivates doubt and demands interpretation; memory seeks certainty and detests that which thwarts its aims. History and memory collide in modern society, often violently. How do young people become historical amidst these forces; how do school, family, nation, and mass media contribute to the process?","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":202817,},

"50K":{"department":"HISTORY","number":"50K","title":"John F. Kennedy: Fifty Years Later","description":"November 22, 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Half a century on, our visually saturated culture remains besotted with images of the youthful president and his strikingly photogenic family. But the passage of time has also yielded new perspectives on Kennedy's presidency and on his era. November 22, 1963 may well come to be remembered not only as the day when the life of a promising young leader was violently cut short, but also as the pivot between two distinct eras in American history. Ironically, though Kennedy was the first World War II veteran to reach the White House, his death heralded the end of the long postwar season of national pride, optimism, confidence, and widely shared prosperity&iquest;and may have opened the road to the great catastrophe that was the Vietnam War. His passing also helped to pry open the portals to historic changes in the lives of millions of African Americans, as witnessed by Lyndon Johnson's artful invocation of the fallen president to bring about passage of the epic civil rights legislation of the late 1960s. nnThis course will examine the postwar domestic and international settings in which Kennedy rose to and exercised power. It will probe our continuing fascination with his character and with his family; his role as a Cold Warrior, especially in the tense confrontation known as the Cuban Missile Crisis; and his relation to the African American struggle to bury Jim Crow. We will conclude with an assessment of the longer-term historical consequence of his brief moment in the arenas of celebrity and power. Guest speakers will include noted Kennedy biographer Robert Dallek; Johnson biographer Bruce Schulman; Taylor Branch, acclaimed biographer of Martin Luther King, Jr.; and Stanford's own Jennifer Burns, historian of modern America.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215018,},
