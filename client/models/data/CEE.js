While this inefficiency results in a heavy social, environmental, and economic burden on both individuals and society as a whole, it also presents an tremendous opportunity to re-imagine how we use and manage our energy consumption. Recent technological advances, including the rise of information technology, sensors, controls, are dramatically re-shaping how energy is utilized, controlled, stored and integrated with traditional supply side resources. These emerging technologies and energy management techniques provide some of the greatest opportunities to improve the efficiency of our economy and address climate change.This course begins with an overview of demand side management (the application of efficiency, demand reduction, distributed generation, storage, and other resource to shape energy demand) practice to date and a detailed look at how energy is used throughout each sector of the economy. Based on this starting point, the course explores emerging technologies and optimization strategies that enable greater insight and control of energy use both at the device and aggregate level, including integration with renewables, storage, and electric vehicles. It then quantifies and monetizes these optimization strategies into revenue streams to both utility and end-user, and culminates in a discussion of how the intersection of these new technologies, optimization strategies, and revenue streams can help de-carbonize the American economy and shape energy use and the utility of the future. Prerequisites: This course is intended for students who wish to gain an understanding of how energy efficiency and demand management occurs in practice. While there are no formal prerequisites, it is expected that students will have familiarity with energy resources and building energy end uses, such as topics covered in CEE 176A/276A, CEE 173A/207A, CEE 156/256, and CEE226E.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":215883,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Kisch, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"10:15:00 AM","instructors":["Kisch, T."],"location":"Littlefield 103"}],"id":29681}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

While this inefficiency results in a heavy social, environmental, and economic burden on both individuals and society as a whole, it also presents an tremendous opportunity to re-imagine how we use and manage our energy consumption. Recent technological advances, including the rise of information technology, sensors, controls, are dramatically re-shaping how energy is utilized, controlled, stored and integrated with traditional supply side resources. These emerging technologies and energy management techniques provide some of the greatest opportunities to improve the efficiency of our economy and address climate change.This course begins with an overview of demand side management (the application of efficiency, demand reduction, distributed generation, storage, and other resource to shape energy demand) practice to date and a detailed look at how energy is used throughout each sector of the economy. Based on this starting point, the course explores emerging technologies and optimization strategies that enable greater insight and control of energy use both at the device and aggregate level, including integration with renewables, storage, and electric vehicles. It then quantifies and monetizes these optimization strategies into revenue streams to both utility and end-user, and culminates in a discussion of how the intersection of these new technologies, optimization strategies, and revenue streams can help de-carbonize the American economy and shape energy use and the utility of the future. Prerequisites: This course is intended for students who wish to gain an understanding of how energy efficiency and demand management occurs in practice. While there are no formal prerequisites, it is expected that students will have familiarity with energy resources and building energy end uses, such as topics covered in CEE 176A/276A, CEE 173A/207A, CEE 156/256, and CEE226E.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":215883,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Kisch, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"10:15:00 AM","instructors":["Kisch, T."],"location":"Littlefield 103"}],"id":29682}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

To answer this question, themes such as memory, mapping, and boundary, among others, will be investigated. part III presents challenges to the traditional notions of place discussed in Part II. Topics addressed include: What does it mean to be \"out of place\"? What sense of place does a nomad have, and how is this represented? What are the \"non-places\" and how can architects design for these spaces? Part IV addresses the need to re-conceptualize contemporary space. The role of digital and cyber technologies, the construction of locality in a global world, and the in-between places that result from a world in flux are topics discussed in this section of the seminar.  nLearning goals: Specific goals include clsoe reading of texts, understanding of philosophical thinking and writing, argument under uncertainty, and developed concepts of place, space and architecture.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"id":211251,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Beischer, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"11:15:00 AM","end":"1:05:00 PM","instructors":["Barton, J.","Beischer, T."],"location":""}],"id":20307}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

In addition to providing an introduction to catastrophe risk modeling, this course will show how the principles of wind engineering are used to estimate the risk of the built environment subjected to catastrophic wind events. Prerequisites: undergraduate fluid mechanics, structural dynamics (CEE 283 or equiv), probability CEE 203.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215045,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Datin, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","instructors":["Datin, P."],"location":"200-305"}],"id":17995}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
