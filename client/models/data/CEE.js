Although the overlap of highway and urban area is sometimes addressed (and re-addressed), it tends to create sub-districts, fragmentation, and unnecessary conditions of separation. nnWhile serving as an important circulation network on the west coast, connecting Los Angeles to Seattle, the infrastructure of Highway 101 cuts through various communities, at times creating division at the local scale.  One of the more marked manifestations of this division is in East Palo Alto, where the highway separates residents on the west side from schools and activities on the east side, acting as a barrier that must be navigated by car. nnThis studio aims to articulate the issues created by the presence of the highway and study design solutions that not only mitigate the presence of these two systems (highway and community) at a general level, but develop strategic approaches to the issues facing the specific area. In this regard, students will engage with the site, community members, and local officials. They will focus on the issues and impact of transportation infrastructure and offer design oriented ideas and responses for addressing the intersection of urban development and highway systems.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":213769,},

While this inefficiency results in a heavy social, environmental, and economic burden on both individuals and society as a whole, it also presents an tremendous opportunity to re-imagine how we use and manage our energy consumption. Recent technological advances, including the rise of information technology, sensors, controls, are dramatically re-shaping how energy is utilized, controlled, stored and integrated with traditional supply side resources. These emerging technologies and energy management techniques provide some of the greatest opportunities to improve the efficiency of our economy and address climate change.This course begins with an overview of demand side management (the application of efficiency, demand reduction, distributed generation, storage, and other resource to shape energy demand) practice to date and a detailed look at how energy is used throughout each sector of the economy. Based on this starting point, the course explores emerging technologies and optimization strategies that enable greater insight and control of energy use both at the device and aggregate level, including integration with renewables, storage, and electric vehicles. It then quantifies and monetizes these optimization strategies into revenue streams to both utility and end-user, and culminates in a discussion of how the intersection of these new technologies, optimization strategies, and revenue streams can help de-carbonize the American economy and shape energy use and the utility of the future. Prerequisites: This course is intended for students who wish to gain an understanding of how energy efficiency and demand management occurs in practice. While there are no formal prerequisites, it is expected that students will have familiarity with energy resources and building energy end uses, such as topics covered in CEE 176A/276A, CEE 173A/207A, CEE 156/256, and CEE226E.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":215883,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"10:15:00 AM","location":"Shriram Ctr BioChemE 108"}],"id":29681}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

While this inefficiency results in a heavy social, environmental, and economic burden on both individuals and society as a whole, it also presents an tremendous opportunity to re-imagine how we use and manage our energy consumption. Recent technological advances, including the rise of information technology, sensors, controls, are dramatically re-shaping how energy is utilized, controlled, stored and integrated with traditional supply side resources. These emerging technologies and energy management techniques provide some of the greatest opportunities to improve the efficiency of our economy and address climate change.This course begins with an overview of demand side management (the application of efficiency, demand reduction, distributed generation, storage, and other resource to shape energy demand) practice to date and a detailed look at how energy is used throughout each sector of the economy. Based on this starting point, the course explores emerging technologies and optimization strategies that enable greater insight and control of energy use both at the device and aggregate level, including integration with renewables, storage, and electric vehicles. It then quantifies and monetizes these optimization strategies into revenue streams to both utility and end-user, and culminates in a discussion of how the intersection of these new technologies, optimization strategies, and revenue streams can help de-carbonize the American economy and shape energy use and the utility of the future. Prerequisites: This course is intended for students who wish to gain an understanding of how energy efficiency and demand management occurs in practice. While there are no formal prerequisites, it is expected that students will have familiarity with energy resources and building energy end uses, such as topics covered in CEE 176A/276A, CEE 173A/207A, CEE 156/256, and CEE226E.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":215883,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"10:15:00 AM","location":"Shriram Ctr BioChemE 108"}],"id":29682}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
