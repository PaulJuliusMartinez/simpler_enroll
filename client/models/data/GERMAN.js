A manuscript collection, which was prepared for the Diet in Augsburg 1518 will be at the core of the course, complemented by an early print from 1512. Besides a panegyric on Maximilian as defender of Christendom against the Turks there are standard lyrics, mostly on the theme of love and some merry topics, punctuated by a considerable amount of politically conceived texts, complaining about grievances and social evils at court. Recent approaches have tried to decipher courtly love poems of pre-conversational times as a method of launching social or political opinions in a disguised way.
