Designed for those with no knowledge of magnetotellurics or electromagnetic induction methods, this class will cover the theory and practice of the MT method with application to both commercial (mineral, oil/gas, and geothermal exploration) and academic (crustal and lithospheric studies). The second half of the class is a hands-on analysis and modelling workshop that will require use of a laptop and instructor-provided codes and data. The analysis will be using various methods to determine dimensionality and directionality, and testing the apparent resistivities and phases for internal consistency. The modelling will be 1D only, but knowledge and skills gained from understanding 1D inversion are equally applicable to 2D and 3D.nTextbook is &iquest;The Magnetotelluric Method: Theory and Practice&iquest; (Chave and Jones, CUP, 2012).","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":216907,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Klemperer, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":["Klemperer, S.","Menzel-Jones, A."],"location":"Mitch350"}],"id":45179}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

This class will give a (slightly futuristic) account of this topic.n In the first part we will focus on regional- to global-scale full-waveform inversion (FWI) using earthquake data. We will review the theoretical foundations of visco-elastic FWI, discuss data requirements, study modern techniques to quantify resolution using second-order adjoints and random probing techniques, and finally highlight some recent applications.In the second part of this class, we will extend the earthquake-based inversions to inversions using the ambient seismic noise field. We will develop interferometric techniques that do not require the traditional assumption of an equipartitioned wavefield, and that allow us to jointly invert for Earth structure and the sources of seismic noise. Furthermore, we will analyze how common noise processing techniques lead to an effective, i.e. distorted, view of Earth structure and noise sources. In the third part we will study how the first and second part maybe combined into a new class of techniques where earthquake and ambient noise data are inverted jointly, instead of following traditional approaches where one is removed from the other.This class will be complemented by small programming examples in order to illustrate basic concepts. Since we will mostly cover ongoing research, this class is also intended to provoke discussions and collaborations.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":217952,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":0}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
