To take advantage of possible creative sparks at the art/science interface, it is necessary for fuzzies and techies to have some knowledge of the language used by the other side.  This interface will be explored through examining approaches used by an artist and an engineer in the context of the materials science of cultural objects.  In-class lectures, hands-on studio practice, and field trips will be used to illustrate these different perspectives.  At the heart of the scientific approach is the notion that a cultural object, e.g., a painting, is a physical entity comprising materials with different physical properties and different responses to environmental stresses presented by light, heat, and water.  In support of this outlook, in-class lectures and discussions will focus on the basic concepts of color, optics, mechanics, composite structures, and response of the object to environmental stress, and we will visit Bay Area museums to see how artists employ such techniques. The hands-on studio experience is designed to increase students' confidence and develop their appreciation of differences in materials.  It is not necessary to have any artistic training, only a willingness to experiment.  The in-class studio projects will include working with line and shadow; color, binders, and mordants; global sources of pigments; substrates and writing; and material failure. Students will make one technical presentation on a topic in one of the five areas relevant to a painting:  color, optics, mechanics, composites, and stress response.  In addition, they will prepare one essay on the issues surrounding the intersection of art and science.  Finally, they will complete a project related to one of the thematic areas covered in the hands-on studio sessions and make a final oral presentation describing their project.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":215401,},
