How environmental policy is formulated in the U.S. How and what type of scientific research is incorporated into decisions. How to determine acceptable risk, the public's right to know of chemical hazards, waste disposal and clean manufacturing, brownfield redevelopment, and new source review regulations. The proper use of science and engineering including media presentation and misrepresentation, public scientific and technical literacy, and emotional reactions. Alternative models to formulation of environmental policy. Political and economic forces, and stakeholder discussions.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["DB-EngrAppSci"],"id":202348,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"5:05:00 PM","location":""}],"id":6086}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
"70Q":{"department":"CHEMENG","number":"70Q","title":"Masters of Disaster","description":"Preference to sophomores. For students interested in science, engineering, politics, and the law. Learn from past disasters to avoid future ones. How disasters can be tracked to failures in the design process. The roles of engineers, artisans, politicians, lawyers, and scientists in the design of products. Failure as rooted in oversight in adhering to the design process.
