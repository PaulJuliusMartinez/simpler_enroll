Mathematical topics include the Fourier transform, the Plancherel theorem, Fourier series, the Shannon sampling theorem, the discrete Fourier transform, and the spectral representation of stationary stochastic processes. Computational topics include  fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and nonuniform FFTs.  Applications include  Fourier imaging (the theory of diffraction, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) and the theory of compressive sensing.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215142,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Candes, E."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"10:20:00 AM","instructors":["Candes, E."],"location":"380-380D"}],"id":45225}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"}}
