Artists, arts leaders, and creative entrepreneurs are taking advantage of new platforms and models for making art and for bringing art to new audiences. The course will feature guest speakers who are developing new ways to engage audiences, create powerful collaborations, and identify new funding sources for artistic activity.  While drawing upon speakers and examples in the visual arts, this course will introduce methods for understanding and engaging with audiences and funders that are applicable to all types of art.  Students will also have the opportunity to investigate collaborative models of their own choosing and will be encouraged to design completely new models--either for realizing an individual art project or for establishing an arts organization. Students will be taught methods for investigating the needs, motivations and resources of audiences/funders. Grading will be based on class participation, which will be supported by submitting periodic reflections and questions, and one project presentation.  The course is available to advanced undergraduate students and graduate students and will be offered pass/fail.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":217292,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Tiews, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Edwards, L.","Tiews, M."],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 370"}],"id":28889}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
