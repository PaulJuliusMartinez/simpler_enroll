Have you danced along to \"Gangnam Style\"? As we become increasingly exposed to Asian popular culture and the Internet facilitates instant access to new media, previous localized forms of entertainment--animated cartoons, comics, video games, music videos, film, and soap operas--have become part of a global staple. However, these cultural forms have emerged not only in their original form with mediation of subtitles. Many have undergone various processes of adaptation and translation so that we no longer recognize that these products had ever originated elsewhere. This course will immerse students in a range of Japanese and Korean cultural phenomena to reveal the spectrum of translation practices across national boundaries. We will inquire into why these cultural forms have such compelling and powerful staying power, contextualize them within their frames of production, and explore the strategies, limitations, and potential of translational practices.nnContact instructor for place. dafnazur@stanford.edunKnight 201.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II"],"id":216980,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Zur, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Zur, D."],"location":""}],"id":28732}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Lewis, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Lewis, M."],"location":""}],"id":28731}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"},
