As readers, we see words printed in different fonts, sizes, and typefaces, typically static on a page. As listeners, we hear a speech signal riddled with variation. We are exposed to words, but a single word is produced differently each time it is uttered. These words stream by listeners at a rate of about 5 syllables per second, further complicating the listeners' task. How listeners map a speech signal into meaning despite massive variation is an issue central to linguistic theory. The field of experimental phonetics investigates how listeners take words that often vary drastically and understand them as quickly and adeptly as they do. This class introduces students to acoustic and auditory phonetics. As a class, we will carry out a project in experimental phonetics aimed at understanding how different realizations of words are able to be understood by listeners. Throughout the course, students will read background literature, become familiar with the Stanford Linguistics Lab, and learn to use software integral to the design, data collection, and data analysis of experiments. Each week, we will have two meetings,one in a seminar setting and one in the lab.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":213205,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sumner, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"2:15:00 PM","instructors":["Sumner, M."],"location":"200-107"}],"id":29013}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
