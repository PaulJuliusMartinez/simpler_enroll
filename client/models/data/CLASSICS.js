"161":{"department":"CLASSICS","number":"161","title":"Introduction to Greek Art I: The Archaic Period (ARTHIST 101)","description":"In the decades 480-460, just before work began on the Parthenon, the sculptor Myron, creator of the Discus-Thrower, was even more celebrated for his bronze cow.  Ancient authors describe an image so palpably alive that shepherds threw stones at her, thinking that she had strayed from the herd, and bulls vied for her attention.  A century later, the quest for mimesis prompted a contest between two artists.  Zeuxis painted a bunch of grapes seductive enough to attract hungry birds; Parrhasios then added a linen curtain, which Zeuxis asked to be removed from his painting.  Zeuxis conceded defeat since he had fooled only birds, whereas Parrhasios had deceived an artist. nnThis course explores the art and culture of the ancestors of these men.  The Greeks of the archaic period (1000-480) would have understood the painters&iquest; competitive zeal, but only toward the end of the period would they have recognized naturalism as an artistic aim. nnEarlier Greek art is more abstract than life-like, closer to Calder than Michelangelo.  In the eighth century Homer&iquest;s descriptions of the rippling muscles (and egos) of his heroes, and the grief of Achilles&iquest; horses, evoke living men and sentient animals, but his fellow sculptors and painters prefer abstraction.nnThis changes in the seventh century as a result of commercial contacts with the Near East and Egypt.  Imported bronzes, ivories and other Near Eastern exotica alerted Greek artists to a wider range of subjects, techniques and intentions, including naturalism.  Later in the century, Greek expatriates learned the art of carving hard stone from Egyptian masters and soon marble sculpture and architecture spread throughout Greece. nnIn the course of the sixth and early fifth centuries Greek artists assimilate what they had borrowed, compete with one another, obey and disobey their teachers, test the tolerance of the gods and eventually produce works of art that speak with a Greek accent.  When the Persians invaded the Acropolis in 480 and 479, they encountered artifacts with little trace of alien influence or imprint and, at Salamis and Plataea, fought decisive battles in which the Greeks prevailed.  In the aftermath of the war, as the Greeks rebuilt their cities and their lives, Myron&iquest;s cow reminded them of their debts to other cultures and their resolve to remain true to their own.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":112453,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Maxmin, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,true],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:50:00 AM","instructors":["Maxmin, J."],"location":"McMurtry Building rm 360"}],"id":15461}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"162":{"department":"CLASSICS","number":"162","title":"Introduction to Greek Art II: The Classical Period (ARTHIST 102)","description":"The class begins with the art, architecture and political ideals of Periclean Athens, from the emergence of the city as the political and cultural center of Greece in 450 to its defeat in the Peloponnesian War in 404.  It then considers how Athens and the rest of Greece proceed in the fourth century to rebuild their lives and the monuments that define them.  Earlier artistic traditions endure, with subtle changes, in the work of sculptors such as Kephisodotos.  Less subtle are the outlook and output of his son Praxiteles.  In collaboration with Phryne, his muse and mistress, Praxiteles challenged the canons and constraints of the past with the first female nude in the history of Greek sculpture.  His gender-bending depictions of gods and men were equally audacious, their shiny surfaces reflecting Plato&iquest;s discussion of Eros and androgyny.  Scopas was also a man of his time but pursued different interests.  Drawn to the inner lives of men and woman, his tormented Trojan War heroes and victims are still scarred by memories of the Peloponnesian War, and a world away from the serene faces of the Parthenon.  His famous Maenad, a devotee of Dionysos who has left this world for another, belongs to the same years as Euripides' Bacchae and, at the same time, anticipates the torsion and turbulence of Bernini and the Italian Baroque.  In the work of these and other fourth century personalities, the stage is set for Alexander the Great and his conquest of a kingdom extending from Greece to the Indus River.

Libations to the gods and to the dead required vases from which to pour them. Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers. At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children.

Only once before had this happened--in ancient Greece. This course asks how the Greeks did this, and what they can teach us today. It uses texts and archaeology to trace the material and military sides of the story as well as cultural developments, and looks at Greek slavery and misogyny as well as their achievements.
