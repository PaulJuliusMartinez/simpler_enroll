Perhaps nowhere is this gift as rare and crucial as in our attempt to understand the experience of mental illness. This is particularly true of that state clinicians call \"psychosis.\" But psychosis is a slippery term, with definitions ranging from being \"out of touch with reality\" to states of hallucination and delusion, to \"disorganization of thought and speech.\" It is devastating and terrifying both for patients and families, and yet shares many characteristics with other, less pathological states, such as mysticism and creativity. How then can we begin to make sense of it? In this course, we will examine the first-hand experience of psychosis in letters, memoirs and fiction. Our goal will be to learn how to read such texts from multiple perspectives, examining not only clinical, social, and historical aspects of psychosis, but also what they offer as unique literary works or art. We will look at texts as diverse as Shakespeare and the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, supplementing them with film and art. This class is not only for students thinking of career in medicine, psychology or anthropology, but also readers and writers interested exploring extraordinary texts. Along the way, we will be paying attending to lessons that we take for our own writing, both fiction and non-fiction.
