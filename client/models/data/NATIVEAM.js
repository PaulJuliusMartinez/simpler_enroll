Using an innovative combination of online lectures by Stanford faculty and students, and recorded interviews with Indigenous leaders, artists, performers, scholars and museum professionals, the seminar will explore and problematize: historic and contemporary understandings of \"Indigenous cultural heritage\" and the impact of colonialism, urbanization and other forces on Indigenous identity and cultural heritage; current and potential domestic and international legal and non-legal frameworks for Indigenous cultural heritage protection and repatriation; past and present museum approaches to Indigenous peoples and their cultural material; and optimal methods of resolving repatriation disputes. While the seminar will cover primarily the situation of Indigenous peoples in North America, comparisons will be drawn with other regions of the globe. The on-campus component of the seminar will involve directed discussions of the online content, the online forum, assigned readings and short writing assignments. Students can choose between a final exam, paper or video project. Lunch is provided.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-ED"],"id":215692,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Jessiman, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"12:15:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","instructors":["Jessiman, S."],"location":""}],"id":29594}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
