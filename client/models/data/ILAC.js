Moreover, medieval Iberia was neither a stage of permanent religious war --the Reconquista-- nor a haven of peace and tolerance among the three great religions that coexisted in the peninsula: Christians, Muslims and Jews. The historical reality is always more complex than the myths and platitudes that prevail in popularizing views of the past. And though the myths will be examined, as well as major historiographical disputes, the objective of the course is to study the interaction between the various Iberian societies, from conflict (conquest, colonization, destruction, captivity, slavery, forced conversion, persecution of dissidents) to coexistence.
