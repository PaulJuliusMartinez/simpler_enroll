Scientists and engineers will have a chance to apply their technical knowledge to the field of music while musicians will learn how sound behaves physically and how it can be recorded, processed, and reproduced.  Using the newly opened Bing Concert Hall as a focal point, we will study the science of sound recording, room acoustics, and multi-channel mixing and playback.  Students will use what they learn to create short multi-channel compositions using special techniques to place sounds spatially. These pieces will be performed during the annual outdoor Summer CCRMA Transitions concert and again during the Fall 2014 CCRMA concert at Bing Concert Hall.  We will use the  textbook by Jay Kadis entitled Science of Sound Recording as our primary text and incorporate plenty of hands-on experience with sound equipment and electronics.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"id":209933,},

Musical theater is an untapped resource of potential artistic innovation and has unfortunately become stuck in an ideal of universal accessibility. In present popular culture and the culture of contemporary art forms, musical theater almost exclusively refers to popular productions such as Phantom of the Opera, Rent, Wicked, Jesus Christ Superstar. Although excellent pieces of art in their own way, both dramaturgically and in their ability to evoke emotion through catchy melodies, for the most part each of them have their basis in popular and traditional musical idioms and theatrical forms, seldom exploring more advanced or avant-garde and experimental compositional and theatrical techniques.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"id":214803,},

Musical theater is a perennial site for negotiating social themes of race, class, gender roles, and sexual identity. The American musical has been in constant dialogue with vernacular song and dance idioms, from ragtime and early jazz to rock, pop, disco, hip-hop, and electronic dance music.  Jazz musicians have regularly looked to musical theater for their &iquest;standards,&iquest; as have talent shows from the vaudeville era to American Idol.  Disney musicals, the television series Glee and Smash, and the High School Musical franchise all illustrate how &iquest;musicals&iquest; serve as a medium for negotiating personal identity from childhood through early adulthood, staging the conflicts and attachments that define our everyday lives while connecting these with the culture we live in through the collective medium of song.  nWe will look at a variety of influential historical musicals (Oklahoma, Guys and Dolls, Gypsy, The Music Man, West Side Story) and a few recent shows such as Wicked, Hairspray, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, American Idiot, and The Book of Mormon, asking what the relation is between individual numbers and the overall themes and structures of the shows.  How do lyrics and music combine in a successful song, and how does a song contribute to shape of the show?  How do the dynamics of live theater relate to the presentation of musicals in the mediums of film and television?  In addition to working on selected songs and scenes with the help of Stanford voice and drama faculty, students will attend, discuss, and review Bay area productions (San Jose, San Francisco), including the Broadway by the Bay (Redwood City) production of Cabaret opening on September 13, 2013.  Grading will be based on class discussion, production analysis and reviews, and a choice between a final creative project and a short research paper.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":214228,},

We also explore a group of Indian Jews (Bene Israel) who combine idioms learned from Jewish and Christian missionaries with local Hindu musical traditions. In all our examples musicians translate languages, musical styles, and cultures to unite memories of a Jewish past with the realities of minority status in the present.
