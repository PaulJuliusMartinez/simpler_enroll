There are many effective ways to approach creative expression, and this course will utilize multiple approaches, both in series and in parallel. Parallel processing and multitasking will become the dominant mode as rational, intuitive and physical skills merge. Processes will include changing perception, design by analogy, quick adaptation to changing situations, overcoming creative blocks, and stress reduction to relax into a more creative state of mind. Class sessions will alternate between theory and practice, with two-thirds of the class time spent in the dance studio, creating ways of moving, to embody the concepts that will be detailed in the discussion sessions. Students will study historical and current research on creativity, develop nonverbal kinesthetic languages, work on changing perception and breaking out of routine patterns, incorporate musicality into their dance creations, gain proficiency in adapting to changing situations, and develop individual styles of creativity, rather than looking for one \"best\" methodology. Dance forms will include modern dance, social dance (cross-step waltz) and jazz dance.
