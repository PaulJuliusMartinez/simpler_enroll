Course format consists of: 1.  Weekly Lecture/Seminar Presentation:  Partial list of instructors include Ms. Frank, Dr. Bronte-Stewart and other Stanford medical experts & research scientists, David Leventhal (Director, \"Dance for PD\") and Bay Area \"Dance for PD\" certified master teachers, film-maker Dave Iverson, Damara Ganley, and acclaimed choreographers Joe Goode, Alex Ketley, Judith Smith (AXIS Dance).  2.  Weekly Dance Class:  Stanford students will fully participate as dancers, and creative partners, in the Stanford Neuroscience Health Center's ongoing \"Dance for Parkinson's\" community dance class for people with PD.  This Community Engaged Learning component provides opportunity to engage meaningfully with people in the PD community.  Dancing together weekly, students will experience firsthand the embodied signature values of \"Dance for PD\" classes:  full inclusion, embodied presence, aesthetic and expressive opportunity for creative engagement, and community-building in action.  A weekly debriefing session within Friday's class time will allow students to integrate seminar material with their movement experiences.nnnNO PRE-REQUISITES: No prior dance experience required.

All of the basic elements of dance composition will be creatively touched upon including: style, form, theme and variation, narrative versus abstract methods of expression, elements of time, quality and use of space, motif and repetition.  These different tools will be illustrated and the options and restrictions of each will be explored.
