There are many effective ways to approach creative expression, and this course will utilize multiple approaches, both in series and in parallel. Parallel processing and multitasking will become the dominant mode as rational, intuitive and physical skills merge. Processes will include changing perception, design by analogy, quick adaptation to changing situations, musicality, overcoming creative blocks, and stress reduction to relax into a more creative state of mind. Class sessions will be primarially practice, with two-thirds of the class time spent in the dance studio, creating ways of moving, to embody the concepts that will be detailed in the discussion sessions. Previous dance experience will not be required to take this course. Rationale: Dance in the University plays a vital role in the experience of self-definition. The opportunity to create dance offers students the means to experience the body in new ways through diverse forms of movement. Students come to understand dance as a conduit for impression and expression in society. It becomes a means of giving physical voice to the most private and powerful aspects of an individual's understanding of himself in relation to the world.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":["WAY-CE"],"id":214546,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Moses, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,true],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:15:00 PM","instructors":["Moses, R."],"location":""}],"id":30953}]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},
