Processes will include changing perception, design by analogy, quick adaptation to changing situations, musicality, overcoming creative blocks, and stress reduction to relax into a more creative state of mind.

The opportunity to create dance offers students the means to experience the body in new ways through diverse forms of movement.

Criticism must aspire to reach the heights, depths and strange in-betweens it grapples with in the art of others. Yet criticism owes a singular responsibility to these others, and to the wider culture it seeks to interrogate. Our interrogation will be generated by dance and performance, with possible forays into live visual art, theater, hybrid forms and whatever else we think might suit our purposes. Various methodologies will be debated and employed throughout the course, as students are encouraged to begin (or continue) developing personal philosophies and voices through their writing, however it does or doesn't intersect with their other artistic and intellectual practices. Our meetings will be hands-on affairs, guided by student experiments. 'Experiments' is a key word this class will function like a laboratory, open to all individuals with an interest in better understanding themselves and their world through words and art.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":215538,},
