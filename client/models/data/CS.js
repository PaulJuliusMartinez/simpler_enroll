Course features many small programming exercises, although no prior programming experience is assumed or required. CS101 is not a complete programming course such as CS106A.

We'll look into these questions as we watch others struggle with them in the 2012 Presidential election.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":213606,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Dill, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"10:45:00 AM","instructors":["Dill, D."],"location":"McCullough 126"}],"id":29223}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
"81N":{"department":"CS","number":"81N","title":"Hackers and Heroes","description":"This course is about dreamers, role models, and the spirit of adventure. Hackers are said to be the soul of computing: playful programmers who think progress is best made by trial and error, guided by the \"hacker ethic.\" Another view has hackers as nettlesome troublemakers -- \"computer bums\" at best, or maybe just plain criminals. In this class, you'll decide, by interviewing real hackers about their exploits and learning how to do your own hacks. We'll study major moments in the fifty-year history of hacking and read from texts including Steven Levy's \"Hackers,\" John Markoff's \"What the Dormouse Said,\" Andy Hertzfeld's \"Revolution in The Valley,\" and Peter Seibel's \"Coders at Work.\"","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":216118,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Winstein, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"2:15:00 PM","end":"3:30:00 PM","instructors":["Winstein, K."],"location":"McCullough 122"}],"id":30851}]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},
