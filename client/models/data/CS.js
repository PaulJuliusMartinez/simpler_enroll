{"101":{"department":"CS","number":"101","title":"Introduction to Computing Principles","description":"Introduces the essential ideas of computing: data representation, algorithms, programming \"code\", computer hardware, networking, security, and social issues. Students learn how computers work and what they can do through hands-on exercises. In particular, students will see the capabilities and weaknesses of computer systems so they are not mysterious or intimidating. Course features many small programming exercises, although no prior programming experience is assumed or required. CS101 is not a complete programming course such as CS106A. CS101 is effectively an alternative to CS105. A laptop computer is recommended for the in-class exercises.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":["GER:DB-EngrAppSci"],"id":211646,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":0}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Many of the world's biggest discoveries and decisions in science, technology, business, medicine, politics, and society as a whole, are now being made on the basis of analyzing massive data sets, but it is surprisingly easy to come to false conclusions from data analysis alone, and privacy of data connected to individuals can be a major concern. This course provides a broad introduction to big data: historical context and case studies; privacy issues; data analysis techniques including databases, data mining, and machine learning; sampling and statistical significance; data analysis tools including spreadsheets, SQL, Python, R; data visualization techniques and tools. Tools and techniques are hands-on but at a cursory level, providing a basis for future exploration and application.

This course extends programming from the virtual environment into the physical world, which presents unique challenges. Focus is on three areas of intellectual discourse that are fundamental to the programming of physical devices: communication with the devices; programming of event driven behaviors; and reasoning with uncertainty. The concepts introduced will be put into practical use through a series of class projects centered around programming your personal robot. This course also serves as a good introduction to Experimental Robotics by exposing students to basic concepts and techniques that are relevant for real world robot programming.
