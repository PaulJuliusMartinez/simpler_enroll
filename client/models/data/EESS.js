"41N":{"department":"EESS","number":"41N","title":"The Global Warming Paradox (EARTHSYS 41N)","description":"Preference to freshman. Focus is on the complex climate challenges posed by the substantial benefits of energy consumption, including the critical tension between the enormous global demand for increased human well-being and the negative climate consequences of large-scale emissions of carbon dioxide. Topics include: Earth¿s energy balance; detection and attribution of climate change; the climate response to enhanced greenhouse forcing; impacts of climate change on natural and human systems; and proposed methods for curbing further climate change. Sources include peer-reviewed scientific papers, current research results, and portrayal of scientific findings by the mass media and social networks.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SMA"],"id":211989,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00","end":"12:30:00","location":"Florence Moore Hall"}],"id":3670}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

Numeric models to predict how climate responds to increase of greenhouse gases. Paleoclimate during times in Earth's history when greenhouse gas concentrations were elevated with respect to current concentrations. Predicted scenarios of climate models and how these models compare to known hyperthermal events in Earth history. Interactions and feedbacks among biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and lithosphere. Topics include long- and short-term carbon cycle, coupled biogeochemical cycles affected by and controlling climate change, and how the biosphere responds to climate change. Possible remediation strategies.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-SMA"],"id":210003,"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"14:15:00","end":"15:45:00","location":"SpilkerEng&AppliedSci143"}],"id":3644}],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"}}
