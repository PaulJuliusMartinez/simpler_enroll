Focusing primarily on the archaeological record of shipwrecks and harbors, along with literary evidence and contemporary theory, this course examines how and why ancient mariners ventured across the \"wine-dark seas\" of the Mediterranean for travel, warfare, pilgrimage, and especially commerce. We will explore interdisciplinary approaches to the development of maritime contacts and communication from the Bronze Age through the end of Roman era. At the same time, we will engage with practical techniques of maritime archaeology, which allows us to explore the material record first hand.","min_units":3,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-SI", "GER:DB-Hum", "GER:EC-GlobalCom"],"id":214573,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Leidwanger, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Leidwanger, J."],"location":"Green Earth Sciences131"}],"id":15915}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Cities are the fastest changing components of the human landscape and are challenging our relationships with nature. They are the historical loci of innovation and change, are cultural hotspots, and present a tremendous challenge through growth, industrial development, the consumption of goods and materials. We will unpack such topics by tracking the genealogy of qualities of life in the ancient Near Eastern city states and those of Graeco-Roman antiquity, with reference also to prehistoric built environments and cities in the Indus Valley and through the Americas. The class takes an explicitly human-centered view of urban design and one that emphasizes long term processes.","min_units":3,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":217363,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Shanks, M."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:00:00 PM","end":"1:20:00 PM","instructors":["Shanks, M."],"location":"160-321"}],"id":30362}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
