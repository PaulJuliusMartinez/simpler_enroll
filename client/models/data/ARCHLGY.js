It will also critically examine the theoretical basis for those laws and practices, and consider challenges and avenues for furthering protection of the cultural heritage rights promised in UNDRIP.  As part of that discussion, the seminar will cover the historical context of removal, survival and revival of Indigenous cultural heritage; past and present museum approaches to display, conservation and repatriation; and optimal methods of resolving repatriation disputes.

Without exception, all socio-cultural groups have evidenced complex interactions with the animals around them, both domesticated and wild. However, the individual circumstances of these interactions are hugely complicated, and involve much more than direct human-animal contact, going far beyond this to incorporate social, ecological and spiritual contexts.n\tThis course delves into this complexity, covering the gamut of social roles played by animals, as well as the methods and approaches to studying these, both traditional and scientific. While the notion of `animals as social actors&iquest; is well acknowledged, their use as proxies for human autecology (the relationship between a species and its environment) is also increasingly recognized as a viable mechanism for understanding our cultural and economic past. It will piece together the breadth of human-animal relationships using a wide geographic range of case studies.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":[],"id":215803,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,false,true],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"12:50:00 PM","location":"500-101"}],"id":30609}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
