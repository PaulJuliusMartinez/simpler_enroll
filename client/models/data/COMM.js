This course examines persuasion, the influencing of attitudes, beliefs or behavior, and locates within that broad subject argumentation, the process of reasoning methodically from evidence.  Argumentation, the socially acceptable method of persuasion, typically confines itself to the rules of logic and has as its goal the recognition of states and causal relationships held by the arguer to objectively exist.  Other methods of persuasion can succeed while flouting those rules, but only within limits, as the story of the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes reminds us.  This course will explore whether those limits be accounted for by the capacity limitations and heuristics and biases of human information processing.  Topics to be covered include evolutionary explanations; the central and peripheral routes to persuasion; source, channel and receiver factors; attitude-behavior consistency; the roles of involvement, elaboration, affect and social influence; critical thinking skills and logical fallacies.

This course examines persuasion, the influencing of attitudes, beliefs or behavior, and locates within that broad subject argumentation, the process of reasoning methodically from evidence.  Argumentation, the socially acceptable method of persuasion, typically confines itself to the rules of logic and has as its goal the recognition of states and causal relationships held by the arguer to objectively exist.  Other methods of persuasion can succeed while flouting those rules, but only within limits, as the story of the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes reminds us.  This course will explore whether those limits be accounted for by the capacity limitations and heuristics and biases of human information processing.  Topics to be covered include evolutionary explanations; the central and peripheral routes to persuasion; source, channel and receiver factors; attitude-behavior consistency; the roles of involvement, elaboration, affect and social influence; critical thinking skills and logical fallacies.
