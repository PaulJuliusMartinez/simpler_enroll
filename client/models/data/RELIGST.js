We will comparatively examine case studies from the ancient Christian world and the modern Indian world. The first part of the course will be devoted to understanding some of the most notable theoretical approaches to ascetic behavior in the field of religious studies while the second part of the course will be devoted to close readings of the cases in light of these theoretical approaches.

It may appear as a spiritual path or as a heavily marketed commodity.  It generates lawsuits as teachers dispute ownership of certain styles, or as some Americans oppose its teaching yoga in public schools.

Having migrated to Euro-America in the late nineteenth century, today yoga is everywhere--studios, schools, gyms, malls, resorts, ashrams, retreat centers.  It comes in many flavors¿austere, with meditative instructors and Sanskrit chants; stylish, in 105-degree heat, with portable-miked instructors loudly motivating students to go through poses with speed and intensity; niche-crafted to meet the needs of busy professionals, pregnant women, senior citizens, or people with back problems.  It may appear as a spiritual path or as a heavily marketed commodity.  It generates lawsuits as teachers dispute ownership of certain styles, or as some Americans oppose its teaching yoga in public schools.  In the first half of the course we will study the history of yoga in India, reading primary texts composed between about 500 BCE and 1600 CE.  In the second half we will learn about yoga¿s globalization in the last century.

Levinas was influenced by Bergson, Husserl, Heidegger, and others, like Buber and Rosenzweig.  We will look at the philosophical world in which he was educated and explore his unique development as a philosopher in the years after World War Two.  Levinas reacted against the main tendencies of Western philosophy and religious thought and as a result shaped novel, powerful, and challenging ways of understanding philosophy, religion, ethics, and politics.  n\tIn this course, we will examine works from every stage of Levinas's career, from his early study of Husserl and Heidegger to the emergence of his new understanding of the human condition and the primacy of ethics, the face-to-face encounter with the human other, the role of language and the relationship between ethics and religion, and finally his understanding of Judaism and its relationship to Western philosophy.  We will be interested in his philosophical method, the relevance of his thinking for ethics and religion, the role of language in his philosophy and the problem of the limits of expressibility, and the implications of his work for politics.

Born in Lithuania, Levinas lived most of his life in France; he was primarily a philosopher but also a deeply committed Jewish educator who often lectured and wrote about Judaism and Jewish matters.  Levinas was influenced by Bergson, Husserl, Heidegger, and others, like Buber and Rosenzweig.  We will look at the philosophical world in which he was educated and explore his unique development as a philosopher in the years after World War Two.  Levinas reacted against the main tendencies of Western philosophy and religious thought and as a result shaped novel, powerful, and challenging ways of understanding philosophy, religion, ethics, and politics.  n\tIn this course, we will examine works from every stage of Levinas's career, from his early study of Husserl and Heidegger to the emergence of his new understanding of the human condition and the primacy of ethics, the face-to-face encounter with the human other, the role of language and the relationship between ethics and religion, and finally his understanding of Judaism and its relationship to Western philosophy.  We will be interested in his philosophical method, the relevance of his thinking for ethics and religion, the role of language in his philosophy and the problem of the limits of expressibility, and the implications of his work for politics.  We shall also consider his conception of Judaism, its primary goals and character, and its relation to Western culture and philosophy.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214637,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"12:50:00 PM","end":"2:05:00 PM","location":"160-120"}],"id":56436}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

This course will address pressing questions about the role of religion in modern society by looking at the historical development and current form of the theory of secularization.  The central goals of the course are to understand the meaning of 'secular' against its counterpart, 'religious,' and to understand the many issues involved in distinguishing these terms and applying them to gain a greater understanding of the dynamics and tensions of modern life.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214987,"primary":[[],[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:15:00 PM","location":""}],"id":58176}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},
