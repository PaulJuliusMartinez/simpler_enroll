In this course, we will explore the diverse traditions of both epics from their Sanskrit versions, first composed more than 2,000 years ago, through retellings in newer media forms well into the twenty-first century. Among our primary interests will be comparing versions of each epic that have circulated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the West at different times. We begin with abridged translations of both the Sanskrit Mahabharata (including the Bhagavadgita) and the Ramayana. We will discuss the major literary, religious, and social themes of each text as well as subsequent translations and transcreations of the stories in Indian and Southeast Asian contexts during the last thousand years. We will also investigate the modern lives of the epics, including their transformations into Indian television serials, film versions of both narratives (from India and America), and invocations of the epic stories in contemporary art, culture, and political disputes. Students will gain exposure to some of the foundational texts for the study of South Asia, both past and present. More broadly, students will cultivate the ability to fruitfully approach texts from different cultures and learn to critically analyze the impacts and roles of stories in various religious, literary, and historical contexts.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum", "WAY-ED"],"id":214738,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Truschke, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Truschke, A."],"location":"200-105"}],"id":30388}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

We will study ways in which religious leaders, movements, and discourses have (1) promoted violent conflict, aggression, and oppression; and (2) contributed to nonviolence, peacebuilding, and liberation of the oppressed.  An overarching theme will be a view of religions as fields of interpretation. No religion is essentially violent or peaceful; intricately connected to the world around them, religions become what they become through interpretation and action. Each week will have two meetings: one featuring an outstanding guest lecturer and one to discuss the lecture topic, with assigned readings and films. Topics under consideration include: Buddhism and Violence; Dorothy Day and Catholic Nonviolent Resistance to Nuclear Weapons; Just War and Jihad; The Contribution of Negro Spirituals to Liberation; The Quakers: Pacifist Convictions and Activism; Violence/Nonviolence in Jainism; The Role of Christian Faith in M.L.

They do, however, present a range of viewpoint and of style that will help frame and re-frame our views on the good life. They will illustrate and question the role that great texts can play in a modern 'art of living.' Perhaps most important, they will develop and reward the skills of careful reading, attentive listening, and thoughtful discussion.

"86":{"department":"RELIGST","number":"86","title":"Exploring the New Testament (CLASSICS 43)","description":"The New Testament is many things to many people.  Around the globe, it is and has been for two millennia a source of culture, law, and faith.  It has been used both to undergird battles for civil rights and to fight against them.  It has been used both to justify wars and to argue that all war is unjust.  Yet, many people haven&iquest;t read the New Testament and still more haven&iquest;t looked at it from historical, sociological, comparative and literary frameworks.  This course will provide you the opportunity to read the New Testament and to study it closely.  We will ask questions of the New Testament about the early Jesus movement, how it fits into its historical context and how it developed.  We will look at the range of opinions and views about Jesus present in this literature.  We will explore the different genres used by early Christians.  We will examine how this set of Early Christian texts came to be considered the canon.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":214458,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Copeland, K."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Copeland, K."],"location":"160-326"}],"id":45958}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
