The essay sparked debate and greater study of the relationship between religious self-understanding, spirituality, conceptions of nature, and environmental concern and has led to a now well-established scholarly sub-discipline dedicated to the study of &#39;religion and nature.&#39; While many still turn to religions as rich resources for articulating a robust ethical commitment to the environment, others continue to criticize religions as causes of environmental crisis and obstacles that justify human domination over the natural world.  This course is designed as an introductory survey of the complex ideological landscape of religion, nature, and environmental concern and some of the central questions dealt with in area of study.  The central focus of the course will be on the following related questions within the broader discussion of &#39;religion and the environment&#39;: How has the &#39;meaning&#39; of nature been discerned and articulated in different traditions of thought? What have humans sought and discovered in their relationship to nature?  How have conceptions of nature oriented human actions and values and given &#39;place&#39; to humanity within the order of things?  We will begin by reading exemplary texts in religious traditions.  Then, we will move on to talk about the place of nature in modern culture by debating the controversial claim that modern science has left nature &#39;disenchanted.&#39;  We will end by critically evaluating contemporary proposals for reconceiving nature to include a positive religious and spiritual dimension.  The course will cover topics ranging from religious texts to Deep Ecology, American conservationism to Buddhist and Romantic nature poetry, naturalist critiques of religion to religious naturalism, and finally perspectives on the place of religion in dealing with environmental crisis.  Readings will include primary texts from major religious traditions, poetry, and scholarly and philosophical texts from figures including Descartes, Goethe, Nietzsche, J.S. Mill, Thoreau, and Peter Singer.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:30:00"}]}],[],[]]},

"86":{"department":"RELIGST","number":"86","title":"Exploring the New Testament (CLASSGEN 86)","description":"The New Testament is many things to many people.  Around the globe, it is and has been for two millennia a source of culture, law, and faith.  It has been used both to undergird battles for civil rights and to fight against them.  It has been used both to justify wars and to argue that all war is unjust.  Yet, many people haven¿t read the New Testament and still more haven¿t looked at it from historical, sociological, comparative and literary frameworks.  This course will provide you the opportunity to read the New Testament and to study it closely.  We will ask questions of the New Testament about the early Jesus movement, how it fits into its historical context and how it developed.  We will look at the range of opinions and views about Jesus present in this literature.  We will explore the different genres used by early Christians.  We will examine how this set of Early Christian texts came to be considered the canon.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-AII"],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"12:50:00","end":"14:05:00"}]}],[]]},

"93":{"department":"RELIGST","number":"93","title":"Exploring Zoroastrianism","description":"Zoroastrianism was once considered one of the great religions of antiquity. It was the state religion of the Persian Empire and its theological influence has been traced in Graeco-Roman mystery cults, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. Yet, today it is one of the least understood of living religions. This introductory class will introduce and analyze Zoroastrianism through some of its defining themes, including an examination of the figure of the prophet Zoroaster, modes of transmitting sacred knowledge, the nature of good and evil, and the importance of ritual practice and practitioners. We will also discuss how Zoroastrianism views the individual with respect to the body, the life cycle, and issues of gender and sexuality. Finally, this course will also examine the intersection of religion and ethnicity that has defined Zoroastrianism from its origins in the 2nd millennium BCE up to the present.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"primary":[[],[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"16:15:00","end":"17:30:00"}]}],[]]}}
