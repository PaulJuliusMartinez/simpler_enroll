Among our primary interests will be comparing versions of each epic that have circulated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the West at different times.

We will discuss the major literary, religious, and social themes of each text as well as subsequent translations and transcreations of the stories in Indian and Southeast Asian contexts during the last thousand years. We will also investigate the modern lives of the epics, including their transformations into Indian television serials, film versions of both narratives (from India and America), and invocations of the epic stories in contemporary art, culture, and political disputes.

"71":{"department":"RELIGST","number":"71","title":"Jews and Christians: Conflict and Coexistence (JEWISHST 71)","description":"The relationship between Judaism and Christianity has had a long a controversial history. Christianity originated as a dissident Jewish sect but eventually evolved into an independent religion, with only tenuous ties to its Jewish past and present. At the same time, Judaism has at times considered Christianity a form of idolatry. It seems that only since the catastrophe of the Holocaust, Jews and Christians (Catholics and Protestants) have begun the serious work of forging more meaningful relationships with each other. This course explores the most significant moments, both difficult and conciliatory ones, that have shaped the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and introduces students to some of the most important literature, art, and music that are part of it. nSelected literature: Gospel according Matthew, the letters of St. Paul, St. Augustine, the Talmud (selections), Maimonides, Martin Luther's sermons on the Jews, Nostra Aetate (Vatican II)nArt and Music: Medieval art and sculpture, Haendel's Messiah.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum", "WAY-ED"],"id":214191,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"3:00:00 PM","end":"4:20:00 PM","instructors":[],"location":"School of Education 206"}],"id":43284}]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
"86":{"department":"RELIGST","number":"86","title":"Exploring the New Testament (CLASSICS 43)","description":"The New Testament is many things to many people.  Around the globe, it is and has been for two millennia a source of culture, law, and faith.  It has been used both to undergird battles for civil rights and to fight against them.  It has been used both to justify wars and to argue that all war is unjust.  Yet, many people haven&iquest;t read the New Testament and still more haven&iquest;t looked at it from historical, sociological, comparative and literary frameworks.  This course will provide you the opportunity to read the New Testament and to study it closely.  We will ask questions of the New Testament about the early Jesus movement, how it fits into its historical context and how it developed.  We will look at the range of opinions and views about Jesus present in this literature.  We will explore the different genres used by early Christians.  We will examine how this set of Early Christian texts came to be considered the canon.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":["WAY-A-II", "GER:DB-Hum"],"id":214458,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Ahmed, T."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"2:50:00 PM","instructors":["Copeland, K.","Ahmed, T."],"location":"160-326"}],"id":45958}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
