Examining the interplay between private desire, romantic sentiment, family relations, and political passion, we will explore how men and women in China grapple with emotional and social issues in modern transformations. We will consider romantic love, the uplifting of sexuality into political passion, the intertwining of aesthetic experience with politics, nostalgia in the disenchanted modern world, and the tensions between the individual&iquest;s self-realization and the community&iquest;s agenda. Students will learn to &iquest;read&iquest; films as a work of art and understand how film works as expression of desire, impulse, emotional connections, and communal bonding during times of crisis.
