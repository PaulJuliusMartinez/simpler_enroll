Focus is on implementation science and evaluation of health care delivery innovations. Topics include implementation science theory, frameworks, and measurement principles; qualitative and quantitative approaches to designing and evaluating new health care models; hybrid design trials that simultaneously evaluate implementation and effectiveness; distinction between quality improvement and research, and implications for regulatory requirements and publication; and grant-writing strategies for implementation science and evaluation.

Provides an in-depth review of intervention approaches for health promotion and disease prevention and covers the leading theories of behavior change. Follows an integrative model to demonstrate similarities and differences between the theoretical approaches, seeking what is useful and worthwhile in each theoretical model rather than looking primarily for what is most easily criticized.  Focuses on the specifics of needs assessments and intervention development and delivery and how these may vary across community settings, with diverse populations, addressing different behaviors, and leveraging traditional and emerging delivery channels. Explores examples of intervention creation, delivery, effectiveness, and sustainability to identify and better understand the resources and other practical considerations necessary to produce, deliver, monitor, and disseminate an intervention with demonstrated effectiveness. Examples drawn from across the behavioral spectrum and include tobacco control, physical activity, healthy diet, stress and distress, as well as consideration of the complexities of extending interventions to target multiple risk behaviors. Students develop a foundational understanding of behavior change theory, rigorous research methods, and creative design strategies to advance the health of individuals and communities.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":216807,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":""},{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":"Li Ka Shing Center, room 208"}],"id":27516},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":""},{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":"Li Ka Shing Center, room 208"}],"id":28709}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":"Li Ka Shing Center, room 208"}],"id":45712}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

Students will engage in in-depth interdisciplinary study of disease detection and control strategies from a \"systems science\" perspective, which involves the use of common mathematical modeling and operations research techniques such as optimization, queuing theory, Markov and Kermack-McKendrick models, and microsimulation. Lectures and problem sets will focus on applying these techniques to classical public health dilemmas such as how to optimize screening programs, reduce waiting times for healthcare services, solve resource allocation problems, and compare macro-scale disease control strategies that cannot be easily evaluated through randomized trials. Readings will complement the lectures and problem sets by offering critical perspectives from the public health history, sociology, and epidemiology. In-depth case studies from non-governmental organizations, departments of public health, and international agencies will drive the course. Open to upper-division undergraduate students.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":214214,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Basu, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Basu, S."],"location":"Littlefield 103"}],"id":26962}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
