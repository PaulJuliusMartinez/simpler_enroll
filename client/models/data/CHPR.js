"228":{"department":"CHPR","number":"228","title":"Theoretical Foundations and Design of Behavioral Intervention Trials","description":"Focuses on the knowledge and skills, respect and thoughtful practice of designing health promotion interventions that are relevant, theoretically-informed, have broad impacts, and can endure. Provides an in-depth review of intervention approaches for health promotion and disease prevention and covers the leading theories of behavior change. Follows an integrative model to demonstrate similarities and differences between the theoretical approaches, seeking what is useful and worthwhile in each theoretical model rather than looking primarily for what is most easily criticized.  Focuses on the specifics of needs assessments and intervention development and delivery and how these may vary across community settings, with diverse populations, addressing different behaviors, and leveraging traditional and emerging delivery channels. Explores examples of intervention creation, delivery, effectiveness, and sustainability to identify and better understand the resources and other practical considerations necessary to produce, deliver, monitor, and disseminate an intervention with demonstrated effectiveness. Examples drawn from across the behavioral spectrum and include tobacco control, physical activity, healthy diet, stress and distress, as well as consideration of the complexities of extending interventions to target multiple risk behaviors. Students develop a foundational understanding of behavior change theory, rigorous research methods, and creative design strategies to advance the health of individuals and communities.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":216807,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":""},{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":"Li Ka Shing Center, room 208"}],"id":27516},{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":"Li Ka Shing Center, room 208"},{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"6:20:00 PM","instructors":["Prochaska, J."],"location":""}],"id":28709}],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,false,false,false],"start":"9:00:00 AM","end":"9:50:00 AM","instructors":[],"location":""}],"id":0}],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"}}
