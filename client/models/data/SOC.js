Anthropologists call these rituals. Rituals shape every aspect of our lives, creating our symbolic universes and governing the most minute of our practices. nnFor early anthropologists and for those interested in religious and symbolic life, rituals and rites were seen as both one of the most universal features of human existence, and, as that which enables us to reflect upon our human existence. A prominent example are that of the &iquest;rites de passage&iquest; found in every culture, from puberty initiation rites, weddings or funerals, which socially signal the change from one status to another. While initially for anthropologists, rituals marked the difference between the sacred and the profane, soon scholars began to see the ubiquity of ritual and the symbolic in shaping even the most mundane activity such as the structure of a meal and why one is not meant to eat dessert before the main course. The first half of the class examines these different debates surrounding the meaning and effects of rituals and rites. The second half of the class takes these debates to think about the question of power and politics. We return to the question of how our symbolic universes are staged and imagined by us through ritual forms such as the annual Presidential &iquest;pardoning the turkey&iquest; at Thanksgiving. The question of power however pushes us even further to ask why it is that we obey particular kinds of authority, consent to particular actions, and find ourselves doing things we haven&iquest;t consciously decided to do. Many have argued that these kinds of political questions about how we respond and are shaped by power have something to do with our symbolic worlds and ritual, from the most obvious (the monarchy) to the most subtle (listening in a classroom). Throughout the course, these abstract questions will be grounded in cross-cultural examples and analysis.","min_units":5,"max_units":5,"gers":["WAY-SI", "WAY-ED"],"id":214938,"primary":[[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Thiranagama, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,true,false],"start":"10:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","instructors":["Thiranagama, S."],"location":"50-51A"}],"id":19261}],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

The emphasis on the party requires a contextualization of two processes that have shaped the functioning of the institutions of the state in the last decades&iquest;one operating below the state and the other operating abovenFrom below the state, the fragmentation of interests has been challenging the traditional identities that used to be embedded in the party. From above, international economic processes have been undermining the role of the state, and thus of the party, as the main vehicle for bringing grievances into the political arena. Thus, part of the agenda of the party is dominated by the activities of organized social movements that only partially follow traditional cleavages (class, status, race, ethnicity, urban/rural), while another part is dominated by multinational firms and banks that only partially represent national interests. Yet, to the extent that the institutions of the state remain relevant, the political party remains a powerful and significant actor of Modern democracies. The fundamental question of this class is to understand the way in which the party continues to shape the functioning of the state.n We will approach this question analytically and historically. Analytically, we will read through various definitions of what a party is. The aim is not to arrive at a &iquest;correct&iquest; definition of the party (there is not such a thing!) but to sharpen the differences between the several approaches.
