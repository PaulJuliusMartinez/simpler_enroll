A challenge throughout a clinical career is to conduct relationships with patients and colleagues in a manner that is professional, perceptive, confident, and authentic. Horses mirror and magnify our intentions and behaviors. Working with horses requires sensitivity to nonverbal cues, discrimination in the quality and amount of physical contact, and an awareness of one's emotional state, all important skills for relating to patients. Horses give non-judgmental feedback about our personal communication and leadership styles and our ability to operate from a place of empathy and kindness. The course also teaches how to recognize subjectivity in judgment and how to overcome fear and immobility in the face of uncertainty. No riding is required and no previous horse experience is assumed. Open to anyone with direct patient care responsibility, space permitting.  Limit 12 students.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":206175,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Johnson, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"11:30:00 AM","instructors":["Schillinger, E.","Kane, B.","Johnson, A."],"location":""}],"id":31747}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},
