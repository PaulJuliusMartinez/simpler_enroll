A challenge throughout a clinical career is to conduct relationships with patients and colleagues in a manner that is professional, perceptive, confident, and authentic. Horses mirror and magnify our intentions and behaviors. Working with horses requires sensitivity to nonverbal cues, discrimination in the quality and amount of physical contact, and an awareness of one's emotional state, all important skills for relating to patients. Horses give non-judgmental feedback about our personal communication and leadership styles and our ability to operate from a place of empathy and kindness. The course also teaches how to recognize subjectivity in judgment and how to overcome fear and immobility in the face of uncertainty. No riding is required and no previous horse experience is assumed. Open to anyone with direct patient care responsibility, space permitting.  Limit 12 students.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":206175,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"9:30:00 AM","end":"11:30:00 AM","location":""}],"id":31747}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Practicum"},

"292":{"department":"FAMMED","number":"292","title":"Clinical Skills Maintenance Experience","description":"(Formerly FAMMED 311) For MSTP students and other Stanford Medical students obtaining combined M.D./Ph.D. degrees through non-MSTP programs only. Students are assigned to a primary care clinic within medicine, family medicine or pediatrics, or a specialty clinic that can offer similar experiences. Continuity of mentorship is the first priority and is desired for reinforcement of basic medical skills; continuity of patients is also desirable, but second priority. Students attend clinic one morning or afternoon per week for two contiguous quarters of the year in which they defend their Ph.D.theses (minimum 10 clinics per quarter). Each four hour clinic session the student: (1) obtains the history of a clinic patient; (2) conducts a physical exam; (3) formulates a differential diagnosis or problem list; (4) presents the patient to her/his clinic preceptor; and (5) prepares a write-up of the case. The clinic preceptor observes and provides guidance for the student's history taking and physical examination skills and critiques the differential diagnosis, verbal presentation, and write-up. The student is guided in the use of the computerized medical record and is asked to progressively integrate this information into the review of the patient history. The clinical preceptor reviews the results of the student's Micro-CPX, Mini-CPX, POM course evaluations, and E4C Mentor evaluations and uses this information to address any perceived weaknesses. The preceptor provides verbal and written performance evaluations to the student and a standardized evaluation becomes part of the student's record. The director of the E4C-MSTP program reviews, on a regular basis, the written performance evaluations of each student taking this course.. Deficits are to be identified and addressed before the student enters clinical training.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":212751,},
