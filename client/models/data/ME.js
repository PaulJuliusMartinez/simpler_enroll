The industrial revolution has been largely about how we sourced, distributed and used energy. It was and continues to be predominantly based on fossil energy. But the impact of our traditional energy sources on climate change is one of the most daunting issues of the 21st century because it will affect the world as a whole - the 7-10 billion people, businesses, nations, ecosystems.  nnThe choice that our society is asked to make is often posed as follows: Should we continue our exponential economic growth based on fossil fuels and ignore the environment, or should we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of our economic growth?  This is a false choice because it is based on extrapolating the past. It does not account for the capacity for innovations in technology, finance and business to create sustainable energy future, one that allows the economy and our environment to be mutually inclusive.

We are looking for students from the sciences, engineering, or mathematics, or students who have business acumen or start-up experience focused on technology driven companies. If you want to get out of your lab, away from your machine, and start to design your future come join us.  The class will begin your journey from research to product conceptualization and user centered design through exercises and group activities. We&iquest;ll meet once a week over the quarter in 10 self-contained 2 hour workshops where students will focus on their own work as well as explore the practical applications of fellow students&iquest; ideas, experience team formation and collaboration, and begin to explore product and service design. Aside from class time you will need to commit up to one hour per week outside the class on customer and market exploration.  Advisors from industry and academia will mentor student teams.

Students learn strategies for understanding and interpreting clinical needs, researching literature and searching patents. Working in small entrepreneurial multidisciplinary teams, students gain exposure to clinical and scientific literature review, techniques of intellectual property analysis and feasibility, basic prototyping and market assessment. Students create, analyze and screen medical technology ideas, and select projects for future development. Final presentations at the end of the winter quarter to a panel of prominent inventors and investors in medical technology provide the impetus for further work in the spring quarter. Course format includes expert guest lecturers (Thu: 4:15 to 6:05 pm), faculty-led practical demonstrations and coaching sessions and interactive team meetings under the mentorship of Biodesign fellows (Tues: 4:15 to 6:05 pm). Projects from previous years included: prevention of hip fractures in the elderly; methods to accelerate healing after surgery; less invasive techniques for bariatric surgery; point of care diagnostics to improve emergency room efficiency; novel devices to bring specialty-type of care to primary care community doctors.
