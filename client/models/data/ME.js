Students then build their command of each skill by completing a simplified yet representative project and submitting deliverables similar to those required in industry. For example, students will learn about how to properly design parts with O-rings and then will be required to design a water-tight enclosure and submit CAD, mechanical drawings, and a bill of materials. Several of the classes feature recent Stanford graduates as guest lecturers. In addition to teaching applicable skills from their job and providing examples from industry, these engineers will also expose students to the range of responsibilities and daily activities that makeup professional mechanical design work.

This quarter, students will learn from 9 different founders / C-level executives about how they built their mobility startup to change the world of transportation. Founders from Tesla, Faraday Future, Zendrive, Renovo Motors and more will be featured. In hearing these founder stories, students will get an insight not only into the world of entrepreneurship but also the multidisciplinary nature of the transportation industry. The course consists of 50-minute discussions with founders, with students encouraged to participate and ask questions of the founders. To obtain credit, students must attend 7 out of 9 classes including the first class (no exceptions.)","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":215836,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Brennan, R."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Brennan, R."],"location":"Y2E2 111"}],"id":57478}]],"primary_type":"Seminar"},

"66SI":{"department":"ME","number":"66SI","title":"Machine Dissection","description":"This course is designed to help engineering students build their physical intuition through a series of mini-lectures, mechanical &iquest;dissection&iquest; activities, student presentations, and a final project. Some of the mechanisms students will dissect include a wind-up toy, fishing reel, and car transmission. Through these activities, students learn the process and value of reverse engineering, develop a better understanding of the design choices made by engineers, become familiar with historically significant mechanisms, and develop both oral and graphical communication skills necessary for working in a technical team. This course is intended for freshman/sophomore engineering students with some knowledge of physics, but little &iquest;hands on&iquest; experience.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":217864,"primary":[[],[],[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Sheppard, S."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,false,true,false],"start":"1:30:00 PM","end":"3:20:00 PM","instructors":["Sheppard, S.","Raitor, M."],"location":""}],"id":57702}]],"primary_type":"Activity"},
