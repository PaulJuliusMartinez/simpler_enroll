This revolution has resulted in exponential growth in the world&iquest;s economy as well as unprecedented prosperity and improvements in our quality of life. The industrial revolution has been largely about how we sourced, distributed and used energy. It was and continues to be predominantly based on fossil energy. But the impact of our traditional energy sources on climate change is one of the most daunting issues of the 21st century because it will affect the world as a whole - the 7-10 billion people, businesses, nations, ecosystems.  nnThe choice that our society is asked to make is often posed as follows: Should we continue our exponential economic growth based on fossil fuels and ignore the environment, or should we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of our economic growth?  This is a false choice because it is based on extrapolating the past. It does not account for the capacity for innovations in technology, finance and business to create sustainable energy future, one that allows the economy and our environment to be mutually inclusive.  In short, we need a new industrial revolution.  nnThis seminar course will: (a) provide a view of the current energy landscape and the magnitude of the challenge; (b) discuss some techno-economic trends that we are currently witnessing; and (c) identify opportunities to innovate in technology, finance and business that could create the foundations for a new industrial revolution.","min_units":3,"max_units":3,"gers":[],"id":215762,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Majumdar, A."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,false,true,false,false],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"12:15:00 PM","instructors":["Majumdar, A."],"location":"530-127"}],"id":29358}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Introsem"},

In this course, students learn how to develop comprehensive solutions (most commonly medical devices) to some of the most significant medical problems. The first quarter includes an introduction to needs finding methods, brainstorming and concept creation. Students learn strategies for understanding and interpreting clinical needs, researching literature and searching patents. Working in small entrepreneurial multidisciplinary teams, students gain exposure to clinical and scientific literature review, techniques of intellectual property analysis and feasibility, basic prototyping and market assessment. Students create, analyze and screen medical technology ideas, and select projects for future development. Final presentations at the end of the winter quarter to a panel of prominent inventors and investors in medical technology provide the impetus for further work in the spring quarter. Course format includes expert guest lecturers (Thu: 4:15 to 6:05 pm), faculty-led practical demonstrations and coaching sessions, and interactive team meetings (Tues: 4:15 to 6:05 pm). Projects from previous years included: prevention of hip fractures in the elderly; methods to accelerate healing after surgery; less invasive techniques for bariatric surgery; point of care diagnostics to improve emergency room efficiency; novel devices to bring specialty-type of care to primary care community doctors. More than 300,000 patients have been treated to date with technologies developed as part of this program and more than thirty venture-backed companies were started by alums of the program.
