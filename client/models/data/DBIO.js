Conserved molecular and cellular pathways regulate tissue and organ development; errors in these pathways result in congenital anomalies and human diseases. Topics: molecules regulating development, cell induction, developmental gene regulation, cell migration, programmed cell death, pattern formation, stem cells, cell lineage, and development of major organ systems. Emphasis on links between development and clinically significant topics including infertility, assisted reproductive technologies, contraception, prenatal diagnosis, teratogenesis, inherited birth defects, fetal therapy, adolescence, cancer, and aging.","min_units":2,"max_units":2,"gers":[],"id":127348,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Kingsley, D."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,true],"start":"11:30:00 AM","end":"12:20:00 PM","instructors":["Kim, S.","Kingsley, D."],"location":""}],"id":26809}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},

The class runs in parallel with the Frontiers in Biological Research seminar series.  Students and faculty meet on the Tuesday preceding each seminar to discuss a landmark paper in the speaker's field of research.  Following the Wednesday seminar, students meet briefly with the speaker for a free-range discussion which can include insights into the speakers' paths into science and how they pick scientific problems.","min_units":1,"max_units":1,"gers":[],"id":127322,"primary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Harbury, P."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,false,true,false,false],"start":"3:30:00 PM","end":"5:20:00 PM","instructors":["Pringle, J.","Villeneuve, A.","Harbury, P."],"location":"Clark Center Auditorium"}],"id":26724}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Seminar","secondary":[[{"primary-instructors":[],"secondary-instructors":["Pringle, J."],"meeting-times":[{"days":[false,true,false,false,false],"start":"4:30:00 PM","end":"5:50:00 PM","instructors":["Villeneuve, A.","Pringle, J.","Harbury, P."],"location":"Beckman Center B302"}],"id":27500}],[],[]],"secondary_type":"Discussion"}}
