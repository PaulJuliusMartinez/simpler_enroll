{"201":{"department":"DBIO","number":"201","title":"Development and Disease Mechanisms","description":"Mechanisms that direct human development from conception to birth. Conserved molecular and cellular pathways regulate tissue and organ development; errors in these pathways result in congenital anomalies and human diseases. Topics: molecules regulating development, cell induction, developmental gene regulation, cell migration, programmed cell death, pattern formation, stem cells, cell lineage, and development of major organ systems. Emphasis on links between development and clinically significant topics including infertility, assisted reproductive technologies, contraception, prenatal diagnosis, multiparity, teratogenesis, inherited birth defects, fetal therapy, adolescence, cancer, and aging.","min_units":4,"max_units":4,"gers":[],"id":127348,"primary":[[{"instructors":[],"meeting-times":[{"days":[true,true,false,true,true],"start":"11:00:00 AM","end":"11:50:00 AM","location":""}],"id":53791}],[],[]],"primary_type":"Lecture"},
